&ldquo;support&rdquo; as in customer &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams has anything to do with getting help solving your problems with a product by a helpful group of people eager to help you out. - An

Just open your favorite news outlet and pick a random article for a sample of things that are wrong with the world. There is a high chance that you will encounter major problems, existential </span><span>threats, and various</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;sorts of suffering. At first glance the frustrations experienced as customers requiring support for problems with products / services don&#39;t seem to be the most pressing problems facing humanity right now. Nevertheless, it&#39;s very likely that if you ever tried to: get a legitimate money refund for a product or service; make an insurance claim; cancel a contract or subscription with a service provider whether its a bank or some other entity; or solve any problem that requires a bit more attention-to-detail than what an average 14 year old person could provide. you experienced various roadblocks and a labyrinth of dark tactics to prevent you from achieving your goal. So, what are the common features and circumstances that give rise to unsupportive behavior from the people tasked with providing support to customers to solve the problems encountered while interacting with products? Are these issues really as irrelevant as they may seem at first glance?</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Disclaimer: the issues described in here are inspired by first hand experiences. Due to the scarcity of publicly available and reliable data on the global prevalence of support-related sufferings the analysis heavily relies on best guesses and assumptions. It is acknowledged that over-generalizing from a few instances is risky and should generally be avoided. However, the risk of ignoring some very frustrating (true for sure) and potentially wide-spread and common experiences (the extent of which needs to be investigated) with real-world costs outweighs the risk of not being 100% accurate about the scale of the problem. The analysis also makes an attempt to clarify that unpleasant experiences are direct consequences of the fundamental principles of established systems and not random events. Nevertheless, the questionable parts of the analysis are mostly related to the scale of the issues while the existence of the issues is beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. even one instance contradicting a theory claiming that the support teams are in support of the customer is enough to </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682599723&amp;usg=AOvVaw27XzfWlhKukKIyfQyyyoCJ">falsify </a></span><span class="c11">that theory).</span></p><h1 class="c26" id="h.gpa9tmln5c0d"><span class="c87">Setting</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Let&#39;s start by describing the situation where we assume that both customers and support team members are humans interacting with each other to solve a problem facing the customer. All humans care about a complex set of concepts to varying degrees according to their personality, life history, aspirations, current levels of perceived need-fulfillment, etc. While the list of needs is potentially unlimited due to all the different ways they can be conceptualized, and because there is an unlimited number of ways you can combine concepts with objects of desire in the world. Nevertheless, several theories have been proposed to identify the most important / most universal set of attributes that people care about.</span></p><h3 class="c47" id="h.qj4nrtbefk5q"><span class="c7">Human suffering and the relevance of problems</span></h3><p class="c3"><span>Perhaps the most well-known motivational theory is </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%2527s_hierarchy_of_needs&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682601130&amp;usg=AOvVaw0c3igfAtsbHOXQx4Xru1qp">Maslow&rsquo;s formulation</a></span><span>&nbsp;about the hierarchical organization of needs. Physiological needs refer to desire for basic things such as access to clean air, water, food, shelter. Such needs arise from the desire to survive and they essentially represent physical objects of desire. People care about their own and their loved ones&rsquo; safety and security encompassing health, financial security, emotional and physical safety, privacy, protection from all sorts of threats. Belonging needs stem from the social nature of humans. People prefer to be surrounded by family, friends, and trusted peers where intimacy and acceptance can be experienced. Esteem </span><span>needs refer</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;to self-respect and being respected by others, the desire to be perceived (both by the self and by others) as competent, and a good, worthy person. Examples of esteem needs include fairness, trust, reciprocity, freedom of choice, etc. Self-actualization and transcendental needs capture desires to be part of a bigger whole, and go beyond the individual&rsquo;s immediate short-term needs (i.e. to transcend oneself). While a potentially endless list of instincts, needs, desires, etc. can be created, it should also be possible to measure their intensity in some way. A measurement of their intensity would make it possible to rank desires, to make comparisons between options i.e. to model how humans make decisions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>There are various concepts to capture a measure of desirability related to potential outcomes of a decision. Valance, (expected) utility, value, etc. are unit-free measures utilized in decision-theory and related fields to characterize the strength of a motivational force propelling decisions and actions. Several methods have been devised to assist in making optimal choices, which provide the highest level of satisfaction or utility among a set of options. With the help of a rational and transparent decision-making tool people are assumed to be able to evaluate options (e.g. which car to buy based on their features and based on how much one cares about those features) and find the best one according to their needs or preferences.

While it may be tempting to come up with various metrics based on some ratios derived from the analysis (e.g. How much more undesirable is global warming for the individual compared to contracting an incurable disease? or How much one would be willing to pay to avoid problems with the support based on the amount of effort exercised to prevent global warming?, etc.), the scores assigned to needs and problems as well as the final severity scores are all at the ordinal </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682646124&amp;usg=AOvVaw2HfeF2opNdSwwv1j9sz_gY">level of measurement</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;at best, enabling only rank ordering the options and problems. Such relative quantifications are only meaningful within the context of the analysis and should not be used outside of their initial context.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>To enable inter-contextual comparisons among needs and ordering of options based on their capability to fulfill various needs a common base is necessary. An ideal common base should be defined objectively, unambiguously and have the properties of a ratio scale when it comes to the </span><span class="c11">levels of measurement. Time is a great candidate for a common base if we think about it in terms of the amount of time we spend in different modes of behavior, or the amount of time we spend experiencing various states of mind. One hour spent creating something meaningful is definitely more preferable than one hour spent in physical or mental pain.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">And because time is money (at least in business), and money seems to have all the desirable features of a common base, one can go on and quantify options and problems by the monetary gains and losses associated with the available options and the unavoidable problems. Money gives a certain amount of freedom of choice to fulfill desires with various objects and to pay the price of avoiding something undesirable. Money in this sense acts as an instrumental goal as it opens up a wider set of options by indirectly making it possible to fulfill the more important terminal goals: how we spend our limited time. Therefore, the amount of money gained or lost is only relevant to the extent that it allows experiencing misery for a shorter period of time and to the extent that it enables experiencing a more pleasurable state for longer: for example by spending less time feeling hungry by having enough money to buy food.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>So, f</span><span class="c11">or people who think that the quantification of abstract and hard-to-objectively-define phenomena like &ldquo;needs&rdquo;, &ldquo;desires&rdquo; or &ldquo;emotional suffering&rdquo; is subjective, ambiguous and problematic in so many ways, there is another possibility: one can quantify each problem in terms of the concrete and hard monetary losses by using real data or best-guess estimates where data is lacking.

Whether it is a computer model, a mental model or some other model, a model is an approximation of the real thing. It is the basic nature of models that they are never fully complete (i.e. necessarily ignoring some parts of the whole), while (hopefully) accurately capturing the parts relevant for the purpose of the analysis. Since the meaning of the &ldquo;best&rdquo; (i.e. complete, highly accurate, lacking major errors, etc.) model for characterizing both humans and organizations is only relative to any other model, perhaps the search for the &ldquo;Best&rdquo; (i.e. most complete, most accurate) model only leads to futile and never-ending arguments about the similarities and differences between humans and organizations and how well each model approximates the overlapping and disjoint features of both.

Based on this fact, it is also perfectly valid to claim that the concept of an organization is meaningless without humans, i.e. no organization has an independent existence from the people running it. The implication is that the organization&rsquo;s behavior can be best understood by analyzing the motivations and activities of the people within the organization. Linking corporate behavior to actual individuals is a tricky task, but checking for the strength of relationship between the characteristics of key decision-makers - who, by the way, are to a large extent shielded from important consequences of their decisions - and the actions attributed to the corporation may get us closer to a more accurate model. Data is sparse on corporate - and several other key - decision-makers&#39; mental setup due to challenges with subjecting people to compulsory psychological assessments and the associated difficulties related to the validity of data obtained from such assessments.

Some of the traits highly prevalent among senior corporate leaders include egocentricity, predatoriness, recklessness, lack of empathy, manipulation, exploitation, deception, lack of morality, charisma, persuasiveness, creativity. There are dynamic interactions between humans and organizations whereby people with certain traits and features tend to get attracted to various organizations and into various roles, then a subset of these people get selected into certain positions, and a smaller subset of these people end up exerting a disproportionately large influence within and outside of the organization.

Within this view behavior is not explained only in terms of personal characteristics or pathologies, but the equally or even more important influences encoded in the situations that people are embedded in. This framework may start with the hypothesis that the majority of people within organizations share all the basic features with humans outside the boundaries of the organization (since they are drawn from the general population, although not completely randomly), but those features are altered by the roles, contractual agreements, job requirements, incentives, policies, duties, etc. according to some principles. In this view the organization is a key situational cue which regulates behavior by defining what is expected, what is allowed, what is encouraged and incentivized, and what is prohibited within the organization. Playing by the rules is rewarded, breaking the written or implicit rules is penalized. The benefit of the P-S interactionist model is that it opens up the opportunity to investigate both of the main categories of the antecedents of human behavior: personal factors (e.g. personality, values, motivations, etc) and situational factors (e.g. compliance, obedience, conformity, group pressures, etc.), uniting divergent research fields within psychology, behavioral economics and related fields.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Situations may be defined as part of the broader environment (i.e. natural, social, economic, business, political environment) or in a narrower sense where immediate transient influences are more dominant on shaping the fine-grained behavior (e.g. time pressure, orders from higher-ups, incentive system, prospect of a bonus, etc.).

There would be no sense in making a transaction if only the same objective values were exchanged. Even when the same amount of money is exchanged in a transaction, the subjective value assigned to that very same amount may be different between two parties. Imagine a person with a 10 USD banknote in his pocket trying to use a parking machine which accepts coins only. There is another person who has 10 USD in coins in his pockets, who would be happy to convert them into a less heavy object: a banknote. Given that these two persons meet, a successful transaction might take place leaving both parties happy where everyone leaves the transaction with 10 USD in their pockets by exchanging 10 USD worth of coins for 10 USD worth of banknotes. The transaction takes place simply because the subjective value assigned to the same amount of money by the parties is different: one values the 10 USD in coins higher than in a banknote, while the other party values the 10 USD banknote higher than the same amount of money in coins. Exchanges only make sense if value is perceived very differently between parties (a transaction in a way represents an agreement about disagreement). When a customer values the artifact offered for sale by the organization higher than the amount of money the artifact is provided for by the organization, then the customer happily sacrifices a certain amount of money to extract the value from the artifact provided by the organization. The organization on the other hand values the customer&rsquo;s money more than the value of the artifact offered for sale, therefore the organization is willing to sell it in exchange for the customer&rsquo;s money. If perceptions of value were in total agreement between the parties there would be no reason to engage in any exchange at all. Similarly, an organization values the money it has to pay in salary less than the value generated by the labor of its employees, therefore the organization is okay with sacrificing a certain amount of money for a certain type of work performed by the employee. On the other hand, employees value the money they receive from the organization for their work more than the time they invest in the work, therefore they are willing to exchange their physical or intellectual effort for the salary offered by the organization. Both parties have a sense that they made a good deal because the organization buys labor at a cheap price and sells the product at a higher price while the employee sells his / her effort at a higher price than the perceived value invested in the work.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Transactions and value exchanges are directly related to the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; created by organizations as generally they represent the objects of desire that customers may find useful. Apart from errors and mistakes (which may become more prevalent and more difficult to detect with the ever greater reliance on AI systems) almost everything at large, mature, international organizations is designed with a clear purpose. Intelligent design in this sense refers to purposefully creating some artifact (e.g. products, services, internal documents, policies, business strategy promotion materials, logos, slogans, ads, contracts, design elements, software codes, etc) that serves a clear goal so that each cog can contribute seamlessly to value creation. The artifacts represent a will to achieve a goal. Will and purpose are not meaningful without humans, therefore - with the exception of unintentional errors and mistakes - everything created within an organization serves a human purpose. This purpose may be shared by all, or most of the people within the organizations or the purpose may exist only in a single individual, but somewhere behind any artifact there must be at least one human and a human will. From the organization&rsquo;s perspective the artifacts (products or services) for sale represent instrumental goals (just like money for humans) helping the organization to achieve its terminal goal (accumulation of wealth). Successful organizations tend to provide stuff that (at least some) people find useful by satisfying some of their needs making them willing to enter into a value exchange with the organization. From the customer&rsquo;s perspective only the stuff is relevant, whereas the amount of shareholder value generated by the organization is irrelevant. Therefore, both of the following two conditions are necessary for an organization&rsquo;s legitimate existence: the founders&rsquo; and shareholders&rsquo; desire to create value / wealth for themselves, AND at least one thing that successfully satisfies a need of some customers which makes them (the customer) willing to pay for the stuff. However, if the terminal goal of the organization is wealth accumulation and organizations are only meaningful in relation to human needs and desires, and money is only an instrumental goal for humans (including the owners and shareholders of the organization and its customers), which opens up more degrees of freedom to spend time in different states of mind (the terminal human goal), then a </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682698838&amp;usg=AOvVaw0C7GODUkTpvJwek1cdcfoD">circular system</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;becomes apparent, in which there is nothing more, nothing less than transactions involving time as the fundamental currency. What also becomes apparent through this lens is how the organization satisfies the higher human need for self-transcendence (i.e. to become part of a bigger whole i.e. the organization, which may have an infinite lifespan, a reach surpassing any human individual&rsquo;s capabilities, etc.) uniting mortal individuals by a shared goal which serves as the fundamental reason for the existence of the organization (i.e. to have more time at disposal to continue the game). In this sense objectionable and harmful organizational behaviors may be seen as aberrations of the underlying human need which overrides all other important considerations.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Since all these analyses lead to humans as root causes of the actions of organizations, it is safe to say that organizations are made up of humans whose interests are united through the framework of an organization, and that organizations represent a strong alignment between human interests for value creation (i.e. the generation of wealth). Based on all these considerations the main thesis of this analysis is as follows: humans are multifaceted creatures with a potentially unlimited number of needs, desires and sufferings. Organizations represent unified human needs / desires. Therefore, organizations are meaningless without including human needs, desires, and wills in the analysis. The fundamental reason for the organization&rsquo;s existence is the unified human desire to generate value or wealth for themselves which turns out to be only a substitute for the real thing: a collective need for self-transcendence and a need for having more time to spend in existence. To achieve this goal organizations act both as filters on the multitude of human features (restricting the manifestation of the features unnecessary for reaching the primary goal), and also as amplifiers (perhaps to even pathological levels) on certain features which are beneficial for reaching the primary goal. Therefore, the extent to which the unique features of human individuals are relevant for understanding the behavior of the organization depends on how each feature contributes to achieving the organization&rsquo;s primary goal. The alignment between human intentions and the organization&rsquo;s goal is the most relevant factor for understanding the influence of humans in organizational behavior expressed through the organization&rsquo;s decisions, actions and strategies visible to the outside observer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>No doubt that certain organizations in certain circumstances can display questionable, objectionable and downright harmful behaviors and often they don&rsquo;t really seem like the entities to be trusted with any of the things people care about.

Nevertheless, people in general seem comfortable with trusting corporations as providers of their foods, drinks, medicine, platforms for all kinds of online activities including the ones for keeping in touch with others, managing personal finances, etc. And as long as business goes as usual the organization&rsquo;s problematic or psychopathic nature may remain more or less hidden, but when something hits the fan and issues arise (irrespective of whether the issues are due to the organization&rsquo;s failure or the customer&rsquo;s) its best to be prepared for some hard time trying resolve conflicts, and sorting out those personally important issues.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Just as on a certain level of analysis all organizations are quite alike due to a very small set of sufficiently strong shared features - the purpose to increase shareholder value above all else through the activities of the organization, which is a key governing principle and the single most important internal purpose unifying directors, board members, executive officers, shareholders and other key stakeholders associated with the organization - there are a few basic principles that when present give rise to objectionable, unfair even psychopathic organizational behavior. The main features include the external requirement placed on the organization to take responsibility for something, to fix an issue and most importantly to spend time or money on something which would be reasonably expected during a fair deal, but does not directly create wealth in the short-term.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">There are general events which usually trigger a subset of the customers who experience problems with a product or service to initiate contact with the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team as (paying) customers of an organization. Some triggers may be a part of the normal business and a fully expected behavior from customers like when one has been diligently paying for a health or property insurance for years, and when an illness or lightning strikes, one submits a claim to the insurance company to cover the costs as agreed by both parties in the contract between the customer and the organization. Another kind of trigger may be when the organization changes a policy that is not in the best interest of the customer. There may be errors which are more or less unintentional (but sometimes planned) like a defective product or a non-functional service, overbilling, payments not registered and other kinds of errors on the service provider&rsquo;s side. Note that in all instances the loss is already incurred by the customer so he / she is already placed at a disadvantage to make up for the losses adding to the stresses already present from the initial problem. A kind of inequality is already present, since the best case for the customer is to break even with significant effort at the mercy of the company policy and the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team. And these are the crucial moments where the organization has a chance to act fairly or reveal the psychopath hiding behind all the various masks discussed previously. It is very easy and often more convenient (i.e. less costly) to abuse the imbalance of power and raise roadblocks in front of the customer to prevent them from achieving their goals: make up for a loss, break even from a loss at best, get fair treatment, etc. It is also precisely these circumstances that one can get a glimpse of how the organization actually values customer relationships by observing the organization&#39;s choices: is it going to avoid a short-term loss (pay for the mistake now) at the expense of potentially losing a customer on the long term, OR is it going to act fairly making sure that issues are sorted out (especially if they were the fault of the organization!) by compensating for the customer&rsquo;s losses ASAP, thereby strengthening the trust for a mutually beneficial relationship in the long-term?</span></p><h3 class="c47" id="h.cuaa1xb26qnj"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Support&rdquo; teams as secret organizational weapons in disguise</span></h3><p class="c3"><span>The naive view of customer &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams would suggest that such teams are primarily tasked with helping customers with legitimate claims and with solving problems experienced by the customers with a product or service provisioned for sale by the organization. One would assume that &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams and members of the wider &ldquo;support&rdquo; team are rewarded by the organization based on for example how quickly they reach a satisfactory solution for each customer, what percentage of customers report high levels of satisfaction with the support received, how the number of problems solved contributes to loyal paying customers in the long-term, etc. Well, in such a system that aligns with the customer&rsquo;s interest (and the organization&rsquo;s long term-self interest as well by the way), certain features and behaviors would not be allowed as they will be demonstrated through an exemplary case. The presented case is definitely a negative example from the perspective of customer satisfaction, valuation and long term trust, but it may not represent an exceptional case even if hard statistics on the prevalence of similar issues is lacking at least from the public view. Even if global public statistics are scarce or non-existent, one can get stronger-than-anecdotal evidence about how organizations deal with problems using various sources like the ratings provided on various platforms, court cases against certain companies, forums and blogs related to consumer rights violations etc. Real world experiences from such sources suggest that negative experiences with &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams and consumer right violations are widely prevalent and are not exceptions to the rule suggesting that negative experience represent a carefully designed strategy from the organization to avoid accountability and most importantly to avoid taking action in hopes to keep some money, whatever small that amount may be, which makes the whole practice even more pathetic and truly psychopathic. To be fair with organizations it would be great to include cases that contradict the prevailing views, by collecting a huge number of cases that get solved in a satisfactory way with minimal friction. But this would require organizations to publish their internal statistics both on unsolved (money kept in) and successfully solved in favour of the paying customer (money paid out) cases. Such a level of transparency would allow the observers to draw a more accurate picture of the organizations given that they were willing to share their data. Such a move may also set the norm for other organizations as well. It is perfectly imaginable that the patterns we see in a small scale are the reflections of the patterns at the larger or the largest scale resembling the concept of </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682709237&amp;usg=AOvVaw2K77nlkmDyjyxOqsocK4SS">scale invariance</a></span><span class="c11">. Based on patterns observed in micro-issues (i.e. the organization tries everything in their power to deflect responsibility and to avoid a small immediate loss), one would expect the same behavioral pattern at play for issues involving more serious violations or bigger costs, potentially invoking even finer tactics and more hideous tricks serving the same underlying purpose: avoid any costs.</span></p><h1 class="c26" id="h.ow14dn3vwaky"><span class="c87">An exemplary case</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c11">The entire case can be accessed at !LINK HERE! as an annex.

The tactics are primarily aligned with the narrowly defined short-term financial interest of the organization: to generate wealth at all costs, instead of paying for mistakes, whatever small those costs may be on a per case basis, which is in direct opposition to the customer&rsquo;s interests (and the long-term financial interest of the organization as well).</span></p><h2 class="c36" id="h.khz8buh996r5"><span class="c100">Tactics employed by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team based on the evidence presented in the &ldquo;An exemplary case&rdquo; section.</span></h2><ol class="c4 lst-kix_pf834apx2aat-0 start" start="1"><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Background of the case: a legitimate refund process.</span><span>&nbsp;<br>A legitimate refund process (confirmed by Google in their first notification e-mail) triggered by closing one of the Google Ads payment profiles associated with an active advertiser account.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Error in the organization&rsquo;s systems triggers the attempt to contact the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team.</span><span class="c11"><br>The successful completion of the refund process was blocked by a mismatch between the user interface and the instructions provided in the notification e-mail. There was no button to click on which was mentioned in the first notification. Worth noting that if there was a button to click on the entire procedure could have been avoided. Is the missing button intentional or a mistake? If it&#39;s a mistake is it possible to direct the developer&rsquo;s attention to it? If a customer takes the time and extra effort to report their mistake, will anyone actually check the report? No answer to this question was ever received.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Overly complicated process just to get in touch with the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team.</span><span class="c11"><br>Contacting the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team is intentionally made very difficult. The obvious purpose is to reduce the number of customers who can actually get in touch with the organization. One can get into infinite loops with the useless chatbot which just makes the existing and already read materials more difficult to extract. One has to go through various checks to contact &ldquo;support&rdquo; with drop-down lists pre-filled with generic categories. If the issue is not included in the dropdown list, one either has to provide an inaccurate reason or attempt contact in other ways. No contact emails are provided, most branches lead back to the chatbot. This step already consumes a significant amount of time, potentially filtering out a significant percentage of customers, thus preventing them from reaching the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Extremely low level of respect by the organization for the &ldquo;valued&rdquo; customer&rsquo;s precious time.</span><span class="c11"><br>Wasting a lot of the customer&rsquo;s time and delaying responses is a recurring tactic throughout all the interactions: the first confirmation that a case has been opened, came 2 weeks after sending the initial support request to several email addresses hoping that one of them will land in the right place. The first obvious purpose of delaying communication and solving problems is that the customer may forget about the issue or give up the attempts to get support for the issue, etc. If anything happens to the customer in the significant delays between interactions which prevents further progress is an obvious win for the team and the organization. The second purpose of delaying everything is that the later they need to pay, the more time they have to use the customer&rsquo;s money. Again, any delay is a net gain for the organization. It is interesting to compare the apparent complications in the case with the efficiency and sophistication implemented in other systems of the same organization like biometric or 1-click payment methods when the goal is to extract funds from customers.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Very low information content (something new) in messages by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team (10-15% of actual payload of overall message content).</span><span><br>The use of a polite boilerplate text in all responses despite the context of the conversation probably aims at mimicking care or empathy for the inconveniences generated by the unsolved issue. Unfortunately this is </span><span>just superficial</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;charm to make the customer less frustrated temporarily without the emotional depth of appreciating the customer&rsquo;s real inconveniences. The superficial politeness quickly becomes empty when actual actions by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team don&#39;t match up with the signals of fake concerns and fake empathy. Just like the ratio of useful information / total payload in each message by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team, the ratio of information provided by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team compared to the information provided by the customer is around 15% - a clear evidence of the imbalance in terms of care taken while handling the case.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Regularly ignoring issues / providing explanations for requests that are inconvenient for the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team.</span><span class="c11"><br>Exchanging messages with the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team often feels like messaging a halfwit, especially when requests are totally ignored even if they are clearly expressed and repeated, e.g. the request to transfer the funds to the new payment profile instead of a bank transfer was completely ignored by the helpful &ldquo;support&rdquo; team member while working feverishly on the case. The question about the total amount to be refunded was also totally ignored by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team. Requests for a real explanation on what prevents the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team and the organization to perform a basic bank transfer are always ignored. </span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Constantly trying to sneak out of taking any action that would be beneficial for the customer.</span><span><br>Setting artificial deadlines with opt out as a default option in case of no-action from the customer is a subtle dark tactic that is definitely inspired by well-meaning research in behavioral economics which got subverted from its original intention. Abusing an important principle from behavioral economics happens in a way that a choice architecture which was originally intended to improve the decisions people make (see </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682717996&amp;usg=AOvVaw1OA0p9a1BbL3I4DuKf3ZwX">Nudge</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein), is turned upside down and perverted into a tactic that is beneficial only for the organization by default. It is similar to the delaying tactic, since any omission from the customer (e.g. forgetting to comply with the instructions, forgetting about the email, etc) is a net gain for the organization, as the rules are set up in such a way that if there is no explicit active action from the customer, the refund is cancelled and the money stays within the organization.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Frequent failure to keep agreements and promises.</span><span class="c11"><br>This is the situation where the psychopathic nature of the organization becomes really apparent. Business as usual at the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team involves: ignoring the organisation&rsquo;s error that there was no button to click on, then ignoring a request to transfer funds to another payment account in their own system instead of a bank transfer, then delaying the legitimate refund process for almost 2 months, then not keeping their previous promises on completing the refund according to their terms. This step is also very informative about the &ldquo;rational&rdquo; calculations that drive the organization&rsquo;s entire behavior (avoid any costs at all cost), and how they value the loyalty of paying customers for the long-term (not much).</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Constant violation of norms governing normal social interaction.</span><span class="c11"><br>The organization expects compliance in every way (e.g by requesting a lot of documents from the customer just to verify a straightforward and valid refund claim, even though they are sitting already on a pile of documents which all confirm the identity of the customer and the validity of the claim as it comes directly from their own system verifying itself). However, the rule of reciprocity is constantly violated by not showing any sign of respecting the requests from the customer (ignoring requests and questions, not providing the requested information). This may be a major additional source of dissatisfaction as the violations go to a very basic level. Additionally the superficial boilerplate politeness seems cynical due to the internal contradictions and mismatches between what is communicated in real actions and in empty words.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Demonstrating external untrustworthyness and internal inconsistencies as well: wherever there is a chance for such errors to appear, they will appear (arguments requiring logical reasoning).</span><span><br>The organization lies not just to the customer, but it also fails to respect its own internal rules, first by blocking the refund which was started automatically by their own system as a default reaction to a certain customer action and second by contradicting itself several times: 1. Claiming that a transfer of funds to another payment profile within their system is not possible, therefore a bank transfer is needed, then, 2. </span><span>after</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;the customer provides all the bank account details and waits for more than 1 month, it turns out - after another inquiry - that 3. a bank transfer is not possible, but after further push from the customer, 4. it turns out that only a transfer to another payment profile within their system is possible. These obfuscating tactics make one of the world&rsquo;s biggest tech companies look like a retard and a liar by confusing itself through contractions and internal inconsistencies.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Additional roadblocks and opt-out by default settings in case of inaction from the customer at every possible step.</span><span class="c11"><br>See Event 10. - previously there was no need for identity verification to discuss the details of the refund transfer, but at this time it acts as an additional delay and potential blockage of the process. Any claim that this would ensure the customer&rsquo;s safety is just bullshit in light of the previous interactions where no such check was necessary.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Providing uninformative filler texts to mimic actual progress.</span><span class="c11"><br>There may be some soft internal rule on acceptable response times to live support cases that can be gamed by &ldquo;support&rdquo; team members by providing a filler text response just within the expected timeframe. Again, any delay is a net gain for the organization, any inaction from the customer is a net gain for the organization, therefore any message containing 0 amount of information is sufficient to make it seem like that the case is being processed, when actually nothing is happening.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Recurring logical inconsistencies.</span><span class="c11"><br>Just like the uninformative filler texts, a no-brainer response may be seen better than no response at all, even if the message contains logical errors and contradictions. See Event 12. informing the customer that since the payment profile has been permanently closed the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team is not able to process the refund. Whereas the entire process was triggered BECAUSE of the closure of the payment profile. The standard of &ldquo;support&rdquo; reaches new depths.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">The &ldquo;support&rdquo; team is always ready to close the case at every point during the interaction.<br></span><span class="c11">It is worth noting that even after providing a totally illogical and uninformative response (Event 12, 17, 19 - speculation about what??) more than 1 month after their own deadline for completing a simple transaction, there is no attempt to correct the issue, there is 0 attempt to offer a compensation for the losses. Again, if the customer stops continuing the process for any reason (intentionally or by mistake), it&#39;s a clear win for the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team and for the organization.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Constant diffusion of responsibility.</span><span><br>The representative of the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team often mentions the &ldquo;wider&rdquo; / &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; team, which only means that there is no owner of the case, nobody is dealing with it properly.

This is a very subtle psycho-linguistic trick that can be used as a rhetorical tactic during interrogations, court hearings and in attempts to influence public opinion by purposefully shifting the focus of a discussion from one topic to another in almost a subliminal way. Note that in Event 21 the legitimate refund request - initiated by the organization&rsquo;s own system, then blocked by another system of the same organization, then continuously delayed and blocked by the organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;support&rdquo; team for 73 days up to this point - got magically reframed to a &ldquo;courtesy credit&rdquo;. Nowhere was there any discussion about a courtesy action or credit before - all the discussion revolved around a legitimate refund which was still kept unlawfully by the organization and not released to the customer.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Ignoring and disrespecting simple requests repeatedly.</span><span class="c11"><br>Again, the customer&rsquo;s request to delegate the case to a more competent team member is simply ignored, which is counted as a violation of social norms governing interactions.</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Activation of the default opt-out option, as a fail-safe mechanism for the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team. <br></span><span class="c11">The original case is closed automatically after just 3 days of inactivity from the customer following the miserable discussions with Satish and deciding not to continue with him / her. Nevertheless, the organization is eager to gather extra data on the quality of the interaction with the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team. Again, the organization has no respect toward the customer, and acts shamelessly by asking more of the customer&rsquo;s time with the false pretext that the ratings of the interaction will be used to improve their services. Considering their history of contradictions, external and internal inconsistencies and their narrow minded focus on avoiding even the tiniest cost at all cost, one may be very skeptical whether the term &quot;improvement&quot; implies an improvement that is beneficial for the customer (e.g. educating Satish and his / her dedicated / wider team on how to respect customers and their requests, or changing the policies and scripts that dictate Satish&rsquo;s behavior, etc.) or for the organization (e.g. by just streamlining the abusive practices to make the contradictions less obvious, adding more logic and polite boilerplate text, fine-tuning the timing of fail-safe the opt-out by default options or improving the identification of customers whose requests need to be respected and whose requests and money can be safely stolen since the person is unlikely to take matters further based on careful analysis of the shared documents, written texts, response times and all the features that this hungry behemoth can harvest from its customers, etc.).</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">Persistent repetition of the same patterns and consistency between &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams.</span><span><br>When people (irrespective of their personal features) operate within the boundaries of the organization which acts as a major filter and amplifier on their personal features and they want to be rewarded for their work or just want to avoid penalties, they will attempt to follow policies and rules </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682729244&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HQijJVzLTYNr_K5EQJq4H">however antisocial those rules and policies may be</a></span><span class="c11">. In Event 27 a new &ldquo;support&rdquo; team member checked the case with his / her wider / dedicated team and entered into the same infinite loop as the previous &ldquo;support&rdquo; team member repeating the same well rehearsed, scripted tactics to prevent the legitimate release of the funds to a bank account which is outside of the organization&rsquo;s boundaries (avoidance of a loss / cost however small that may be).</span></li><li class="c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c21">All message exchanges lack the previous responses and no clear overview of pending / unsolved / solved issues.</span><span class="c11"><br>Another subtle but efficient dark UX design decision (i.e. a careful web and interaction related architectural choice) is that while normal email messages usually contain the history of all the previous message exchanges providing an almost instantaneous contextual understanding about the ongoing discussion and providing a clear track record of events, interactions with the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team follow the exactly opposite pattern that purposefully makes it difficult to track the progress of the case by NEVER including the track record of previous events in the most recent message. Even if these messages are sent in an email format, they are always individual message blocks without any context (except for the subject line). Another strongly related dark UX design decision is that there is no dashboard that would provide a summary of all the live, pending, solved cases anywhere on Google&rsquo;s platform. It is beyond doubt that a market leading tech giant could easily build a user interface to provide an overview about the &ldquo;support&rdquo; requests for the customer&hellip; if it was the intention of the organization (or more accurately the intention of the people responsible for these aspects of self-presentation of the organization). But it is clearly not a priority, thus there is just a lack of clear overview of the cases on the customer-facing side of the interface. The choice is understandable considering that providing such a dashboard would make the unfairly and negligently handled cases really easy to extract and make available to the public to help everyone make informed decisions whether they want to engage in transactions with a certain organisation. Obviously such transparency would be against the organization&rsquo;s interest as long as it sticks to its current practices.</span></li></ol><h2 class="c30" id="h.2g2s5inovh63"><span class="c100">Summary of the autopsy</span></h2><p class="c40"><span class="c11">The exemplary case provided an excellent glimpse into the true workings and nature of the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team at one of the world&rsquo;s currently largest tech giants (Google).

When such signals are clearly identified, searching for solutions within the boundaries of the organization may be futile and one may need to look for solutions outside of the organization.</span></p><p class="c40"><span>The overall strategy by certain &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams is based on the assumption that people interacting with them are rational economic decision-makers (</span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682735156&amp;usg=AOvVaw28QiQWvKflw4EJmZyh6obv">even if that rationality is seriously bounded</a></span><span>), who will sooner or later realize the </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682735472&amp;usg=AOvVaw3mhwU5xZEfFJ3fMMo4aOMI">opportunity costs</a></span><span>&nbsp;associated with trying to get their problems fixed by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team. Organizations and their representative &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams have an implicit or explicit expectation that people have other things to do, they have other priorities, a limited time to deal with these issues, and that they will eventually give up trying to get help after repeatedly being stonewalled, disrespected and lied to. With the passage of time the initial loss (of functionality of the service, money, satisfaction from the service etc.) seems to shrink in comparison to the troubles caused by the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team and the amount of time wasted on trying to get the issue solved by them. So the expectation from the organisation is that sooner or later the true nature of the transaction becomes evident as a </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682736482&amp;usg=AOvVaw394CxTwfXoQzF6GvHdimzZ">sunk cost</a></span><span class="c11">, and the fallacy (i.e the hope that with more effort positive results will eventually follow) becomes apparent and the help-seeking behavior is abandoned as it only accumulates additional losses which are impossible to recover due to the way &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams are set up, operated and rewarded within the organization: as secret weapons tasked with avoiding any cost at all costs. Such &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams act as deterrents funneling customer issues and complaints into endless internal loops with the goal of sapping the customer&rsquo;s motivation to obtain what they are rightfully entitled to. However, it is not just the customer&rsquo;s motivation that is getting sapped, but money as well, which is defined in law as theft. Therefore, such &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams are more accurately characterized as internal scam centers operating under the disguise of providers of assistance for customers in need. Using this disguise &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams deliver a double blow to the customer, first by not solving the original issue (representing the initial direct cost), and secondly by wasting a lot of the customer&rsquo;s time and adding a huge amount of extra frustration (representing the indirect costs such as the externalized costs, opportunity costs, etc.) on top of the initial issue.</span></p><h1 class="c26" id="h.csb30oh13w4v"><span class="c87">Solutions available for customers</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c11">It is highly probable that the previously discussed default expectations of the organization and the &ldquo;support&rdquo; team are frequently fulfilled. It would be really surprising to learn that a data-driven tech giant makes any important decision (i.e. how to provide customer &ldquo;support&rdquo;) without careful planning and monitoring the effects of their design decisions. So it can be safely assumed that the powerful default options and settings generate the results they are designed to generate, otherwise customers may have very different experiences with &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Since it is now evident that certain customer &ldquo;support&rdquo; teams (e.g. Google Ads) are only aligned with the organization that feeds them, the naive expectation that customers will get actual support for solving problems with any of the services or products offered by the organization can be safely abandoned. These teams are put into the frontline where customers in need for help are directed through a maze of dark UX elements and when they finally reach a human (as opposed to a useless chatbot), they find the same faceless, brainless and heartless mechanism operating through human &ldquo;support&rdquo; team members, who have neither the clue nor the intention of providing any help as dictated by the internal rules and policies of the organization. There is one rule and that rule is to avoid all costs and responsibility at all costs, no matter what the long-term consequences are for the customers or even for the organisation as a matter of fact.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">There are however, certain strategies that customers can consider when the friendly mask falls and the organization which previously made all the interactions really smooth and streamlined (especially if the interactions involved extraction of customer money or data) turns out to be a truly antisocial adversary.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">It is clear that organizations and their internal scam centers count on the customer&rsquo;s rationality in several ways. First, customers are expected to give up sooner or later due to the irrecoverable indirect costs. So in order to violate this expectation, nobody should ever give up and everyone needs to be persistent, whether within the boundaries of the organization or preferably outside its boundaries. What is fundamentally needed is a way to turn the adversary&rsquo;s secret weapon against itself and let their own internal logic do its work until consequences spiral up so that the organization&rsquo;s best strategy becomes a necessary change of strategy (i.e. handling of customer issues in a way that is more aligned with the customer&rsquo;s interests which by the way may be more aligned with the organization&rsquo;s longer-term interests as well, especially if the issues are a result of the organization&rsquo;s other objectionable practices). Issues should not be fully abandoned and no one should settle for an unfair or illegal outcome, where the result - however nicely packaged - is theft of the customer&rsquo;s money.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>The second key expectation of rationality by the organization towards customers is that no individual will ever start a lawsuit (some cost-benefit analysis is expected from the rational customer) below a certain monetary loss threshold, so the organization feels safe harvesting the money illegally across thousands of similar cases below a certain threshold. Where that threshold lies is probably very precisely known and calculated by the organization (per customer) which increases the informational and power imbalance between the individuals and the organization. A remedy against these expectations is to find others exposed to similar transgressions and form collaborative groups.

Additionally, the efficiency with which consumer rights organizations can generate positive results and enforce changes is limited by a serious bottleneck as their processes need to pass through the legal systems which are usually not designed for efficiency and speed, but for safety by trying to ensure that no legal or natural person gets punished without proper evidence (i.e. everyone is considered </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682745493&amp;usg=AOvVaw2XrkO3-msdxQQR7NYfwNMD">innocent until proven guilty</a></span><span class="c11">).

Organizations on one hand have a clear goal to accumulate wealth and their natural tendency would be to grow infinitely if it was only up to them to follow their internal maxima. What seems to be overlooked and worth remembering is the other necessary condition for an organization&rsquo;s existence: it is supposed to provide something that people are willing to pay for. As soon as customers&rsquo; willingness to pay for a service or product vanishes, a key reason for the organization&rsquo;s existence disappears as well. Therefore the correct(ed) logic is that the organization&rsquo;s existence depends on its ability to fulfill customer needs. As soon as they fail to achieve that, there is no valid reason for their existence. Customer choice is therefore key.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>When the service degrades to unacceptable levels, or the organization grows way too aggressive or antisocial, there is a very simple solution which is available for anyone to use: just stop using the service or product, stop paying for something that is not aligned with one&rsquo;s individual goals. Given that organizations have one primary goal, they must be really sensitive to any changes in the environment that may have a negative impact on reaching that single goal. This provides customers a very rational, straightforward and simple to use mechanism to force organizations to modify their repulsive behaviors and practices. People need to be aware of and exercise their rights to prevent organizations from transgressing their limits (which they are pretty prone to unless clear and immediate collective feedback is provided). Through such awareness and by actively expressing values through actions customers may be able to guide the misbehaving organization </span><span>to teach them what is acceptable and what is not by using the environment wisely.

Customer feedback in the form of boycotts or collective abandonment of an organisation, or brand has clearly visible and near immediate effects. It is especially efficient compared to overly complicated, bureaucratic government interventions and lengthy lawsuits. A clear demonstration of the efficiency of collective conscious choice is that it relatively quickly forced the world&rsquo;s (second, third?) richest man to reconsider his public actions in his own best (financial) interest. Which he did, as a rational self-interested individual acting on behalf of the organization&rsquo;s shareholders. Interesting to note that the plummeting of Tesla stocks due to collective customer action had nothing to do with the quality of the products, nevertheless a message was clearly communicated using the only language that organizations and their representatives seem to understand easily: sales going down. So if effective action is needed with the least possible lag just abandon the misbehaving bastards completely and collectively permanently or temporarily until they fix themselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>With the right shared mindset and through collective action the control to regulate organisational misbehavior is placed directly into the hands of the customers. This kind of control requires consciousness, consistency and coordination among a large number of individuals. What organisations are exceptionally good at is to unite individuals for a common goal. Cooperation and collaboration are essential features required for collective action whether that action is a class action, a collective abandonment of an organization and its products or the creation of new organisations with different approaches. The productive and constructive solution is to cooperate and develop the alternatives, reinvent and reimagine the economic system, create revolutionary business models that can replace the current morass of advertisement-based business models that pollute the informational environment, design products that preserve </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.goatcounter.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682755928&amp;usg=AOvVaw0lQsS7lYjp7kSme01SaHld">privacy</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">instead of violating it, bring to life organisations that are truly able to serve a broader set of goals than the financial interest of the stakeholders, etc.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">It is also a great opportunity to clarify personal values, commitments and align ideals with real-world actions. When collective action is properly organized and directed to a goal many of the greatest harms could be avoided simply by modifying the choices customers make. No organisation would continue extracting natural resources and polluting nature at ever-increasing rates if there was no customer need and a willingness to pay for the products created from such processes. It is useful to ask what exactly are the tradeoffs we make on a daily basis through our (automatic) choices. One may have to answer tough questions after some introspection about the level of destruction that is acceptable to establish or maintain a certain level of convenience and comfort etc.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>As a first step toward reimagining how other potential realities would look like based on a completely different economic system, which is rooted in a completely different mindset with other kinds of valuations, one may get inspiration from the ideas in </span><span class="c8"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.academia.edu/download/119505763/WESTERN_ECONOMICS_VERSUS_BUDDHIST_ECONOM.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754407682757361&amp;usg=AOvVaw3X_KpDWR5taF_ZuDeKc5F_">Buddhist economics</a></span><span>. The consequences of a simple-looking realization made about 2500 years ago - that suffering is at the core of existence - are far-reaching. It leads to the attitude which aims at reducing (or at least not increasing) the overall suffering, where suffering is extended to all sentient beings. Another basic principle that follows from suffering is the practice of</span><span>&nbsp;self-restraint through simplifying desires instead of cultivating and generating them (as often done in the capitalist economic system). Through some practice one may eventually realize that freedom comes not from the constant and compulsive fulfillment of desires which gives rise to new desires perpetually, but from releasing the desires and letting go of attachments to the objects that provide false promises of solving human problems. When that state is achieved by all individuals and the veils blurring our vision are removed, the need for any kind of support will dissipate into the great void of pure existence.</span></p><hr class="c109"><div><p class="c83"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c84">&nbsp;Whether the business environment itself is governed by unmodifiable natural laws or it is a product of some very basic human features and behavioral tendencies (i.e. paranoia about the competitor&rsquo;s behavior, avoidance of uncertainty, etc) needs to be investigated.</span></p></div><div><p class="c83"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c84">&nbsp;Closing the original payment profile associated with the recently successfully triple-verified advertiser account was necessitated by various complications related to the newly introduced advertiser verification requirements.
