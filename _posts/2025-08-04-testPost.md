# The support teams are not what they seem

Why \- in certain circumstances \- you should not assume that the concept of “support” as in customer “support” teams has anything to do with getting help solving your problems with a product by a helpful group of people eager to help you out. \- An analysis of how organisations disguise their dark practices by weaponizing customer “support” teams and turn them into normalized scam centers, sapping customers' funds on a global scale and why nobody is complaining.

## Introduction

There is no shortage of problems in the world nowadays. Just open your favorite news outlet and pick a random article for a sample of things that are wrong with the world. There is a high chance that you will encounter major problems, existential threats, and various sorts of suffering. At first glance the frustrations experienced as customers requiring support for problems with products / services don't seem to be the most pressing problems facing humanity right now. Nevertheless, it's very likely that if you ever tried to: get a legitimate money refund for a product or service; make an insurance claim; cancel a contract or subscription with a service provider whether its a bank or some other entity; or solve any problem that requires a bit more attention-to-detail than what an average 14 year old person could provide. you experienced various roadblocks and a labyrinth of dark tactics to prevent you from achieving your goal. So, what are the common features and circumstances that give rise to unsupportive behavior from the people tasked with providing support to customers to solve the problems encountered while interacting with products? Are these issues really as irrelevant as they may seem at first glance?

Disclaimer: the issues described in here are inspired by first hand experiences. Due to the scarcity of publicly available and reliable data on the global prevalence of support-related sufferings the analysis heavily relies on best guesses and assumptions. It is acknowledged that over-generalizing from a few instances is risky and should generally be avoided. However, the risk of ignoring some very frustrating (true for sure) and potentially wide-spread and common experiences (the extent of which needs to be investigated) with real-world costs outweighs the risk of not being 100% accurate about the scale of the problem. The analysis also makes an attempt to clarify that unpleasant experiences are direct consequences of the fundamental principles of established systems and not random events. Nevertheless, the questionable parts of the analysis are mostly related to the scale of the issues while the existence of the issues is beyond reasonable doubt (i.e. even one instance contradicting a theory claiming that the support teams are in support of the customer is enough to [falsify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} that theory).

## Setting

Let's start by describing the situation where we assume that both customers and support team members are humans interacting with each other to solve a problem facing the customer. All humans care about a complex set of concepts to varying degrees according to their personality, life history, aspirations, current levels of perceived need-fulfillment, etc. While the list of needs is potentially unlimited due to all the different ways they can be conceptualized, and because there is an unlimited number of ways you can combine concepts with objects of desire in the world. Nevertheless, several theories have been proposed to identify the most important / most universal set of attributes that people care about.

### Human suffering and the relevance of problems

Perhaps the most well-known motivational theory is [Maslow’s formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} about the hierarchical organization of needs. Physiological needs refer to desire for basic things such as access to clean air, water, food, shelter. Such needs arise from the desire to survive and they essentially represent physical objects of desire. People care about their own and their loved ones’ safety and security encompassing health, financial security, emotional and physical safety, privacy, protection from all sorts of threats. Belonging needs stem from the social nature of humans. People prefer to be surrounded by family, friends, and trusted peers where intimacy and acceptance can be experienced. Esteem needs refer to self-respect and being respected by others, the desire to be perceived (both by the self and by others) as competent, and a good, worthy person. Examples of esteem needs include fairness, trust, reciprocity, freedom of choice, etc. Self-actualization and transcendental needs capture desires to be part of a bigger whole, and go beyond the individual’s immediate short-term needs (i.e. to transcend oneself). While a potentially endless list of instincts, needs, desires, etc. can be created, it should also be possible to measure their intensity in some way. A measurement of their intensity would make it possible to rank desires, to make comparisons between options i.e. to model how humans make decisions.

There are various concepts to capture a measure of desirability related to potential outcomes of a decision. Valance, (expected) utility, value, etc. are unit-free measures utilized in decision-theory and related fields to characterize the strength of a motivational force propelling decisions and actions. Several methods have been devised to assist in making optimal choices, which provide the highest level of satisfaction or utility among a set of options. With the help of a rational and transparent decision-making tool people are assumed to be able to evaluate options (e.g. which car to buy based on their features and based on how much one cares about those features) and find the best one according to their needs or preferences. The “Structuring Analytical Problems” chapter in Richards J. Heuer’s book entitled [Psychology of Intelligence Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113714.Psychology_of_Intelligence_Analysis){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} provides a great example about a method to assist decision makers in making “good” decisions (i.e. reflecting their real preferences).

The method can be adapted to assess the severity of problems according to one’s personal preferences or needs. The general procedure looks something like this:

1. Identify needs (attributes) that you care about,   
2. Quantify the relative importance of each need (attribute) you care about,  
3. Identify the problems that are relevant for you,  
4. Quantify the relative extent to which each of the problems impact each of your needs (attributes),  
5. Multiply the scores from Step 2 by the scores from Step 4,  
6. Quantify the number of times you encounter each of the problems,  
7. Sum the scores from Step 5 for each problem and multiply them by the number of times you encounter the problem from Step 6 for each problem.

For the purpose of demonstration the following example will use only 5 attributes that a person might care about. A problem may have a negative impact on the following attributes that people in general tend to value in Step 1.:

| 1.1 Identify needs / attributes you care about |  | 1.2. Quantify the relative importance of each attribute you care about by dividing 100 points among them. The sum of the scores should \= 100 / column. |
| :---- | :---- | ----- |
|  |  |  |
| Health |  | 22 |
| Survival of offsprings |  | 21 |
| Belonging |  | 20 |
| Wealth |  | 19 |
| Feeling respected, reciprocity |  | 18 |
|  |  |  |
| Sum |  | 100 |

| 1.3. Identify problems that are relevant for you |
| :---- |
|  |
| Global warming |
| An unsolved issue by the support team |
| Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars |
| Contracting an incurable rare disease |

| 1.4. Quantify the relative extent to which each of the problems impact each of your needs / attributes. For each need / attribute, take 100 points and divide it among the problems based on how much impact they have on that specific need. The sum of the scores should \= 100 / row. |  |  |  |  |  | Sum |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | :---- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |  |  |
| Health | 10 | 0.005 | 0 | 89.995 |  | 100 |
| Survival of offsprings | 95 | 0 | 0 | 5 |  | 100 |
| Belonging | 35 | 0.0005 | 0 | 64.9995 |  | 100 |
| Wealth | 5 | 0.01 | 0 | 94.99 |  | 100 |
| Feeling respected, reciprocity | 15 | 50 | 0 | 35 |  | 100 |

| 1.5. Multiply the scores from Step 1.2. by the scores from Step 1.4. for each attribute \- problem pair |  |  |  |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| 220 | 0.11 | 0 | 1979.89 |
| 1995 | 0 | 0 | 105 |
| 700 | 0.01 | 0 | 1299.99 |
| 95 | 0.19 | 0 | 1804.81 |
| 270 | 900 | 0 | 630 |

An optional step is to include the number of times a problem is experienced in a given time period:

|  | 1.6. Quantify the number of times you encounter each of the problems in a given time period (e.g. year, month, etc.) |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| Baseline estimate | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

The last step combines the scores assigned in the previous steps to quantify the relative severity of the problems for the individual.

|  | 1.7. Sum the scores from Step 1.5. for each problem and multiply them by the number of times you encounter the problem from Step 1.6. for each problem |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| Baseline estimate | 3280 | 900.31 | 0 | 5819.69 |

The following graph shows a ranking of the problems as experienced by the individual:

![Relative importance of the problems for an individual.](/postResources/2025-08-04-testPost/Problemgraph_0_Individual_01.jpg){: width="" height="" }
_Relative importance of the problems for an individual._

It is important to do a sanity check and sensitivity analysis at this point to identify potential errors, contradictions or other issues.

The problem “Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars” has a severity score of 0 as it does not have any direct impact on any of the needs included in the analysis.

“An unsolved issue by the support team” is the second least relevant problem, as one would expect considering the severity of the other problems in the set. This problem affects the least important need “Feeling respected, reciprocity” in a massive way resulting in a not insignificant total score for this problem.

“Global warming” is a pressing existential threat impacting very heavily the “Survival of offsprings” need which is the second most important desire in this setting resulting in a very high total score.

“Contracting an incurable rare disease” is fatal in the short term for the individual, so there is no surprise that this problem gets the highest overall score.

The results reveal how each of the problems contribute to negative experiences and the ranking of the problems enables one to prioritize actions to avoid or mitigate the most pressing ones if possible.

A question that may arise is whether we will get the same results if we wanted to analyze problems at a wider, global scale? If it was feasible to run the same process for every individual one would be able to generate a measure for the overall relevance of these problems at the global scale. Due to several limitations, it is more feasible to try best guesses and estimate the severities. The following extra steps can help with coming up with rough estimates on the global impact of the problems:

8. Quantify the population of the Earth,  
9. Estimate the ratio of the population affected by the each problem,  
10. Estimate the relevance of the problem at the global level by multiplying the scores from Step 7, 9.

Estimated number of humans that may be impacted by problems and sufferings:

| 1.8. Quantify the population of the Earth (\# of individuals) |
| ----- |
| Population of the Earth |
| 8,000,000,000 |

When estimating the ratio of the population affected by each problem one can turn to various statistics, but for the purpose of demonstration the following numbers are guessed:

|  | 1.9. Estimate the ratio of the population affected by the problem |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| Baseline estimate | 1 | 0.2 | 0 | 0.000000000125 |

Due to a lack of real-world global data on individuals’ preferences this step simply assumes that individual preferences are a good-enough representation of the preferences of the general population.

|  | 1.10. Estimate the relevance of the problem at the global level by multiplying the scores from Step 1.7. and Step 1.9. |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| Baseline estimate | 3,280 | 180 | 0 | 0.00000073 |

The graph below illustrates the results from the additional steps to estimate the global impact of the identified problems. The graphs are scaled such that the highest score in the analysis represents 100%, therefore all scores are relative to the max score in the given example.

_Relative importance of the problems on a global scale._

Not surprisingly the problem “Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars” remains the least pressing problem since it does not have any direct impact on any of the needs included in the analysis and it directly impacts 0 individuals.

A person “Contracting an incurable rare disease” becomes the second least significant problem from the perspective of the world at large, even though it was the most severe problem for the individual experiencing the problem. Since one person represents only about 1 / 8,000,000,000 \= 0.000000000125 th of the entire human population, a major individual problem becomes almost irrelevant at the global scale.

“An unsolved issue by the support team” becomes the second most relevant problem at the global scale even if it only impacts 20 % of the population, at 1 issue / individual.

As expected “Global warming” becomes the most pressing problem at a global scale, as it affects the entire population, but the effects are not so immediate as to impact shorter-term desires included in the analysis.

So far, all values were kept constant when analyzing the problems at the level of the individual and at the global scale. However, there are two key variables which are independent of personal preferences and which can be adjusted to better represent the severity of the problems. The number of times a problem is encountered / individual does not change for “Global warming”, “Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars”, and for “Contracting an incurable rare disease” due to the inherent nature of these problems. In the current setting these are dichotomous variables (yes / no, 1 / 0\) at the nominal level of measurement, meaning you are either exposed to the effects of global warming or you are not, you either contract an incurable disease or you don’t, and you either suffer from the lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars or you don’t. However, the troubles experienced due to the unsolved issue(s) by the support team are allowed to take on any value ≥ 0 with no theoretical upper limit.

The variable measuring the ratio of the population affected by each problem also remains the same for “Global warming”, “Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars”, and for “Contracting an incurable rare disease”, since global warming affects the entire population, Lack of atmosphere on Mars affects 0 % of the population at the moment (and in the foreseeable future), while an individual contracting an incurable rare disease is by definition 1 person, therefore the ratio remains the same as in the previous examples. However, the number of people experiencing an unsolved issue by the support team can vary within a clear range: 0-100%. It might be perfectly possible that the previous 20% estimate is a very optimistic lower bound, while there is a hard upper limit of 100% if everyone on the Earth was treated badly by a support team.

Following these considerations and adjusting the numbers to 7 unsolved issues by the support team / individual,

|  | 1.6. Quantify the number of times you encounter each of the problems in a given time period (e.g. year, month, etc.) |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| Slight change from baseline | 1 | 7 | 1 | 1 |

where 53% of the population is affected by the unsolved issues and frustrations caused by the support team,

|  | 1.9. Estimate the ratio of the population affected by the problem |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| Slight change from baseline | 1 | 0.53 | 0 | 0.000000000125 |

the final severity score for unsolved issues by support teams rise dramatically, whereas the scores of the other problems remain unchanged:

|  | 1.10. Estimate the relevance of the problem at the global level by multiplying the scores from Step 1.7. and Step 1.9. |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | Global warming | An unsolved issue by the support team | Lack of breathable atmosphere on Mars | Contracting an incurable rare disease |
| Slight change from baseline | 3,280 | 3,340 | 0 | 0.00000073 |

It becomes apparent from the graph below that support related issues can easily escalate and surpass the perceived severity of Global warming even with only 7 issues / individual when 53% of the population is affected. It is not unimaginable that both numbers still underestimate the prevalence of the problem.

_Relative importance of the problems on a global scale with increased estimates._

In short, the emotional distress caused by the support team’s undesirable behavior at the global scale can surpass the short-term suffering experienced from global warming, indicating that the problem may warrant more attention than one would think at first glimpse.

It is worth noting that \- since people have a potentially unlimited number of needs or attributes they care about, and there are a potentially unlimited number of problems \- a complete and fully accurate matrix is not likely to be achievable. Nevertheless, the presented methods are still useful for modeling problems and to analyze the state of affairs. While it may be tempting to come up with various metrics based on some ratios derived from the analysis (e.g. How much more undesirable is global warming for the individual compared to contracting an incurable disease? or How much one would be willing to pay to avoid problems with the support based on the amount of effort exercised to prevent global warming?, etc.), the scores assigned to needs and problems as well as the final severity scores are all at the ordinal [level of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} at best, enabling only rank ordering the options and problems. Such relative quantifications are only meaningful within the context of the analysis and should not be used outside of their initial context.

To enable inter-contextual comparisons among needs and ordering of options based on their capability to fulfill various needs a common base is necessary. An ideal common base should be defined objectively, unambiguously and have the properties of a ratio scale when it comes to the levels of measurement. Time is a great candidate for a common base if we think about it in terms of the amount of time we spend in different modes of behavior, or the amount of time we spend experiencing various states of mind. One hour spent creating something meaningful is definitely more preferable than one hour spent in physical or mental pain.

And because time is money (at least in business), and money seems to have all the desirable features of a common base, one can go on and quantify options and problems by the monetary gains and losses associated with the available options and the unavoidable problems. Money gives a certain amount of freedom of choice to fulfill desires with various objects and to pay the price of avoiding something undesirable. Money in this sense acts as an instrumental goal as it opens up a wider set of options by indirectly making it possible to fulfill the more important terminal goals: how we spend our limited time. Therefore, the amount of money gained or lost is only relevant to the extent that it allows experiencing misery for a shorter period of time and to the extent that it enables experiencing a more pleasurable state for longer: for example by spending less time feeling hungry by having enough money to buy food.

So, for people who think that the quantification of abstract and hard-to-objectively-define phenomena like “needs”, “desires” or “emotional suffering” is subjective, ambiguous and problematic in so many ways, there is another possibility: one can quantify each problem in terms of the concrete and hard monetary losses by using real data or best-guess estimates where data is lacking. A procedure to estimate the costs caused by the support team may follow the following step:

This basic model of human decision-making is sufficiently general that the same procedures could be easily applied (with a different set of needs / attributes and problems) to the humans within organizations and within “support” teams as well. However, there are additional factors that need to be taken into account. Namely, that members of the “support” team operate within the context of an organization with important implications for the further analysis.

### Organizations and their multi-faceted relationship with humans

Organizations are interesting creations. They are often anthropomorphised due a set of features that are generally attributed to humans like goals, needs, strategies, visions, etc. But in contrast to the majority of living humans \- who have a real personality, values, feelings, emotions, aspirations, and several (often conflicting) motivations \- organizations are legal entities created for a very specific purpose: to generate income for the owners and other stakeholders. Certain organizations, especially limited liability companies are legally required to act in the best interest of their shareholders, where “best interest” is implicitly defined in a very narrow sense: financial interest, assuming that more money is preferred to less. In other words, the sole purpose of limited liability companies is to increase value i.e. wealth, for its shareholders. Corporate law grants limited liability companies a set of special statuses by defining them as legal persons. Some of the special rights that are granted to organizations:

* having [limited liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}: the owners and shareholders of the corporation have a limited liability for losses, ensuring that the owners are legally separated from the organization. When things go wrong only the legal person i.e. the organization is liable, which means that only the organization is held responsible, not the humans behind the actions of the organization. Therefore, the shareholders’ [only risk is to lose money](https://roarmag.org/essays/tni-state-of-power-joel-bakan-interview/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, but they are not really liable for what the organization does on their behalf.  
* right to own property,  
* right to enter into contracts,  
* right against self-incrimination,  
* the right to privacy,

with some duties like paying tax.

Organizations can be also modeled as supra-individual entities with a life cycle, in which they may grow or shrink, they may even become cannibalistic, consuming other organizations, etc. As opposed to biological humans who have a limited lifespan, organizations are potentially immortal as they can be operated by successive generations of individually mortal humans, meaning that organizations have a potentially unlimited time to achieve their goals. These supra-individual entities tend to wear various masks, where a mask or a [persona in the Jungian sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_\(psychology\)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} describes parts of the human personality that are shown purposefully and strategically in social interactions depending on the context, goals, and expectations. Organizations may put on a friendly, playful, attractive even childish mask to reel customers and prospective employees in. For end users, the mask radiates cheerfulness while streamlined, clutter-free, fine-tuned design elements are dominant to make the extraction of the user’s data as easy, rewarding and enjoyable as possible, so people do it more and more at their free will. However, there are less prominent and less friendly masks in the small prints and the [impossible to read](https://www.techdirt.com/2012/04/23/to-read-all-privacy-policies-you-encounter-youd-need-to-take-month-off-work-each-year/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} within a reasonable time and / or [hard to comprehend](https://www.biggestlieonline.com/policy-complexity-analysis-2019/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} end-user license agreements that most people just accept without reading (is it really a freedom of choice to have no choice but accept all unfavourable terms or be excluded from using a service?). A developer aiming to build an app and trying to access the system’s API is faced with another persona that speaks specialized technical language, and openly provides all sorts of details so that both parties can extract as much value from the interaction as possible. Investors and shareholders may meet yet another very different persona on the pages of the quarterly reports. Employees often meet a darker mask hidden from public view with NDA’s and contracts that put strict limitations on the activities one can do even outside of the organization and especially in situations where one becomes a witness to unethical or questionable behaviors within the organization.

Organizations have not only been likened simply to humans, but also to humans with serious mental disorders such as psychopathy (i.e. antisocial personality disorder). According to [Brueckner](https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-3-642-28036-8_128){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} “corporate psychopathic behaviour describes a form of corporate conduct, which meets the psychiatric criteria for human psychopathy; that is, a failure to conform to social norms and the violation of accepted ethical standards without remorse.” For the record, according to the DSM-IV-TR [Diagnostic Criteria](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/pn.39.1.0025a){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for Antisocial Personality Disorder (301.7) a human qualifies for an antisocial personality disorder diagnosis when the person is at least 18 years old, shows evidence of onset of conduct disorder before age 15, and antisocial behavior cannot be explained by schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, AND: “There is a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others occurring since age 15, as indicated by three (or more) of the following:

1. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest,

2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure,

3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead,

4. irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults,

5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others,

6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent work behavior or honor financial obligations,

7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.”

Joel Bakan, author of the book and the accompanying documentary movie The Corporation [claims](https://philosophynow.org/issues/65/The_Corporation_The_Pathological_Pursuit_of_Profit_and_Power_by_Joel_Bakan){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} that some corporations are psychopathic because of their narrow-minded pursuit of self-interest and their inability to have a genuine concern for others. They have a built-in compulsion to externalize costs, a lack of concern for human safety and the environment when such things seem like obstacles to their primary purpose. It is often more profitable for corporations to risk human life, break environmental regulations, pay fines in lawsuits or / settlements out of court, than to implement changes that comply with ethical or environmental regulations. According to [Bakan](https://philosophynow.org/issues/65/The_Corporation_The_Pathological_Pursuit_of_Profit_and_Power_by_Joel_Bakan){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the “quasi-personification of corporations under corporate law is coupled with the concept of moral agency, which ascribes corporate entities the quality of being able to act intentionally and with independent volition. The investment of corporations with these anthropomorphic qualities gives rise to the argument of moral projection. This suggests that corporations should be held accountable to human moral principles, even though they are not real people. This projection principle fuels the contemporary debate surrounding deplorable corporate conduct, which emerged in response to corporations violating moral principles in the pursuit of economic return without legal constraint. In contrast, identical conduct perpetrated by a ‘real’ legal person would be subject to [criminal law](https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-3-642-28036-8_128){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.” Since corporations act (by employing lawyers, analysts, etc.) as rational agents calculating the probability of getting caught and the magnitude of potential losses (both of which are highly uncertain, and the odds can often be manipulated by lobbying, bribing, or by delaying proceedings, thus avoiding accountability, etc.) it’s no surprise that taking the risk seems like the optimal solution. Recent advancements in the research field apply the human psychopathy concept not just to organizations but to the entire system that most organizations are embedded in questioning the [sanity of the global capitalist system](https://www.emerald.com/ijoa/article/33/12/153/1267228/Should-capitalism-be-deemed-psychopathic-and){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

While it is definitely tempting to characterize organizations as living entities with human-like features, the usefulness of this approach depends on the purpose of the analysis and it should not be forgotten that any analysis is always restricted to dealing with an abstraction, or a model of reality. Whether it is a computer model, a mental model or some other model, a model is an approximation of the real thing. It is the basic nature of models that they are never fully complete (i.e. necessarily ignoring some parts of the whole), while (hopefully) accurately capturing the parts relevant for the purpose of the analysis. Since the meaning of the “best” (i.e. complete, highly accurate, lacking major errors, etc.) model for characterizing both humans and organizations is only relative to any other model, perhaps the search for the “Best” (i.e. most complete, most accurate) model only leads to futile and never-ending arguments about the similarities and differences between humans and organizations and how well each model approximates the overlapping and disjoint features of both. According to [Ockham's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} a theory (or model) which relies on fewer assumptions is preferable to another one which requires more assumptions to be valid given that their explanatory power is the same. While anthropomorphising organizations and comparing them to humans with certain psychopathological features is an effective rhetorical device, as a model it introduces several assumptions and interesting theoretical questions such as: would it make sense to expect morally appropriate behavior from a building that is inhabited by humans in the same way as proponents of the "organizations are psychopaths” model expect an appropriate moral code from non-human organizations? Are only organizations older than 18 years allowed to get an official diagnosis? What if the organization did not show signs of onset of conduct disorder before age 15? If certain organizations suffer from mental disorders, are they exempt from punishment? What if the diagnostic criteria used for humans is too vague or expert [judgements](https://meehl.umn.edu/sites/meehl.umn.edu/files/files/138cstixdawesfaustmeehl.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} on the same issue prove to be inconsistent and unreliable? Although the model has interesting implications, it may miss identifying the root cause(s) of problematic organizational behavior. When the organization is modeled as a human, perhaps the analysis misses the real humans in the control / board rooms making the actual decisions which are later attributed to the organization.

Therefore, it is always worth keeping in mind that organizations \- despite their strong resemblance to living creatures or even to humans \- are legal entities acting at the command and on behalf of humans (e.g. owners, shareholders). Based on this fact, it is also perfectly valid to claim that the concept of an organization is meaningless without humans, i.e. no organization has an independent existence from the people running it. The implication is that the organization’s behavior can be best understood by analyzing the motivations and activities of the people within the organization. Linking corporate behavior to actual individuals is a tricky task, but checking for the strength of relationship between the characteristics of key decision-makers \- who, by the way, are to a large extent shielded from important consequences of their decisions \- and the actions attributed to the corporation may get us closer to a more accurate model. Data is sparse on corporate \- and several other key \- decision-makers' mental setup due to challenges with subjecting people to compulsory psychological assessments and the associated difficulties related to the validity of data obtained from such assessments. Nevertheless, [some claims](https://fortune.com/2021/06/06/corporate-psychopaths-business-leadership-csr/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} have been made based on empirical data showing that “12% of corporate senior leadership displays a range of psychopathic traits, which means psychopathy could be 12 times more common among senior management than among the general population”. Some of the traits highly prevalent among senior corporate leaders include egocentricity, predatoriness, recklessness, lack of empathy, manipulation, exploitation, deception, lack of morality, charisma, persuasiveness, creativity. There are dynamic interactions between humans and organizations whereby people with certain traits and features tend to get attracted to various organizations and into various roles, then a subset of these people get selected into certain positions, and a smaller subset of these people end up exerting a disproportionately large influence within and outside of the organization. Such people get rewarded by finding their “niche” i.e. a good level of [person-environment fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person%E2%80%93environment_fit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} for themselves, where their past decisions and actions were especially well-aligned with the primary goal of the organization and its shareholders. So problematic corporate behavior may indirectly be attributed to the competitive and unforgiving business environment which rewards antisocial traits and behaviors in pursuit of short-term business success.[^1] But even if psychopaths are over-represented in senior leadership positions in certain organizations, it is unlikely that the vast majority of people working within organizations would score exceptionally high on psychopathic traits. Nonetheless, some of the collective activities of \- individually well-meaning \- people visible through the actions or “behavior” of the organization are objectionable, even harmful for others. So another question arises: how does collectively problematic behavior arise from the actions of independently non-pathological individuals?

By utilizing a [person-situation (P-S) interactionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewin%27s_equation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} approach one acknowledges that human behavior is a function of both personal and situational variables. Within this view behavior is not explained only in terms of personal characteristics or pathologies, but the equally or even more important influences encoded in the situations that people are embedded in. This framework may start with the hypothesis that the majority of people within organizations share all the basic features with humans outside the boundaries of the organization (since they are drawn from the general population, although not completely randomly), but those features are altered by the roles, contractual agreements, job requirements, incentives, policies, duties, etc. according to some principles. In this view the organization is a key situational cue which regulates behavior by defining what is expected, what is allowed, what is encouraged and incentivized, and what is prohibited within the organization. Playing by the rules is rewarded, breaking the written or implicit rules is penalized. The benefit of the P-S interactionist model is that it opens up the opportunity to investigate both of the main categories of the antecedents of human behavior: personal factors (e.g. personality, values, motivations, etc) and situational factors (e.g. compliance, obedience, conformity, group pressures, etc.), uniting divergent research fields within psychology, behavioral economics and related fields.

Situations may be defined as part of the broader environment (i.e. natural, social, economic, business, political environment) or in a narrower sense where immediate transient influences are more dominant on shaping the fine-grained behavior (e.g. time pressure, orders from higher-ups, incentive system, prospect of a bonus, etc.). Perhaps the most important factors of the situation or the environment are the other parties involved in transactions with the organization like customers, employees, the natural environment. Since \- as far as human activities are concerned \- [ex nihilo nihil fit](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ex%20nihilo%20nihil%20fit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} or “nothing comes from nothing” most transactions result in a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} at best where a gain for one party equals the losses / costs for the other party directly involved in the transaction. However, transactions often have hidden features and hidden costs i.e. [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, where the costs associated with production are offloaded / borne by society or nature. If such costs were internalized and included in the price, consumption would definitely decrease which would be unacceptable for the organization. When rational economic agents follow their narrowly defined self-interest, global consequences may lead to problems like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} where the outcome of the collective actions of “rational” (i.e. pursuing short term self-interest) actors give rise to negative outcomes for all. The key observation is that interests may show several [types of conflict](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37282-7_9){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}: conflict between the short-term and long-term self interest of the same agent, conflict between the interests of parties not in direct transaction with each other, and conflicts between the interests of parties in direct transaction with each other.

The last type of conflict is especially relevant for understanding the kind of circumstances that may give rise to problematic and objectionable organizational behaviors which could easily qualify as psychopathic \- were they presented by a human individual.

### Value exchanges between humans and organizations

Before analysing the specific circumstances where interests of two transacting parties (the organization and the customer) are in direct conflict, it's important to note that transactions are never exchanges of equal values. There would be no sense in making a transaction if only the same objective values were exchanged. Even when the same amount of money is exchanged in a transaction, the subjective value assigned to that very same amount may be different between two parties. Imagine a person with a 10 USD banknote in his pocket trying to use a parking machine which accepts coins only. There is another person who has 10 USD in coins in his pockets, who would be happy to convert them into a less heavy object: a banknote. Given that these two persons meet, a successful transaction might take place leaving both parties happy where everyone leaves the transaction with 10 USD in their pockets by exchanging 10 USD worth of coins for 10 USD worth of banknotes. The transaction takes place simply because the subjective value assigned to the same amount of money by the parties is different: one values the 10 USD in coins higher than in a banknote, while the other party values the 10 USD banknote higher than the same amount of money in coins. Exchanges only make sense if value is perceived very differently between parties (a transaction in a way represents an agreement about disagreement). When a customer values the artifact offered for sale by the organization higher than the amount of money the artifact is provided for by the organization, then the customer happily sacrifices a certain amount of money to extract the value from the artifact provided by the organization. The organization on the other hand values the customer’s money more than the value of the artifact offered for sale, therefore the organization is willing to sell it in exchange for the customer’s money. If perceptions of value were in total agreement between the parties there would be no reason to engage in any exchange at all. Similarly, an organization values the money it has to pay in salary less than the value generated by the labor of its employees, therefore the organization is okay with sacrificing a certain amount of money for a certain type of work performed by the employee. On the other hand, employees value the money they receive from the organization for their work more than the time they invest in the work, therefore they are willing to exchange their physical or intellectual effort for the salary offered by the organization. Both parties have a sense that they made a good deal because the organization buys labor at a cheap price and sells the product at a higher price while the employee sells his / her effort at a higher price than the perceived value invested in the work.

Transactions and value exchanges are directly related to the “stuff” created by organizations as generally they represent the objects of desire that customers may find useful. Apart from errors and mistakes (which may become more prevalent and more difficult to detect with the ever greater reliance on AI systems) almost everything at large, mature, international organizations is designed with a clear purpose. Intelligent design in this sense refers to purposefully creating some artifact (e.g. products, services, internal documents, policies, business strategy promotion materials, logos, slogans, ads, contracts, design elements, software codes, etc) that serves a clear goal so that each cog can contribute seamlessly to value creation. The artifacts represent a will to achieve a goal. Will and purpose are not meaningful without humans, therefore \- with the exception of unintentional errors and mistakes \- everything created within an organization serves a human purpose. This purpose may be shared by all, or most of the people within the organizations or the purpose may exist only in a single individual, but somewhere behind any artifact there must be at least one human and a human will. From the organization’s perspective the artifacts (products or services) for sale represent instrumental goals (just like money for humans) helping the organization to achieve its terminal goal (accumulation of wealth). Successful organizations tend to provide stuff that (at least some) people find useful by satisfying some of their needs making them willing to enter into a value exchange with the organization. From the customer’s perspective only the stuff is relevant, whereas the amount of shareholder value generated by the organization is irrelevant. Therefore, both of the following two conditions are necessary for an organization’s legitimate existence: the founders’ and shareholders’ desire to create value / wealth for themselves, AND at least one thing that successfully satisfies a need of some customers which makes them (the customer) willing to pay for the stuff. However, if the terminal goal of the organization is wealth accumulation and organizations are only meaningful in relation to human needs and desires, and money is only an instrumental goal for humans (including the owners and shareholders of the organization and its customers), which opens up more degrees of freedom to spend time in different states of mind (the terminal human goal), then a [circular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} becomes apparent, in which there is nothing more, nothing less than transactions involving time as the fundamental currency. What also becomes apparent through this lens is how the organization satisfies the higher human need for self-transcendence (i.e. to become part of a bigger whole i.e. the organization, which may have an infinite lifespan, a reach surpassing any human individual’s capabilities, etc.) uniting mortal individuals by a shared goal which serves as the fundamental reason for the existence of the organization (i.e. to have more time at disposal to continue the game). In this sense objectionable and harmful organizational behaviors may be seen as aberrations of the underlying human need which overrides all other important considerations.

Since all these analyses lead to humans as root causes of the actions of organizations, it is safe to say that organizations are made up of humans whose interests are united through the framework of an organization, and that organizations represent a strong alignment between human interests for value creation (i.e. the generation of wealth). Based on all these considerations the main thesis of this analysis is as follows: humans are multifaceted creatures with a potentially unlimited number of needs, desires and sufferings. Organizations represent unified human needs / desires. Therefore, organizations are meaningless without including human needs, desires, and wills in the analysis. The fundamental reason for the organization’s existence is the unified human desire to generate value or wealth for themselves which turns out to be only a substitute for the real thing: a collective need for self-transcendence and a need for having more time to spend in existence. To achieve this goal organizations act both as filters on the multitude of human features (restricting the manifestation of the features unnecessary for reaching the primary goal), and also as amplifiers (perhaps to even pathological levels) on certain features which are beneficial for reaching the primary goal. Therefore, the extent to which the unique features of human individuals are relevant for understanding the behavior of the organization depends on how each feature contributes to achieving the organization’s primary goal. The alignment between human intentions and the organization’s goal is the most relevant factor for understanding the influence of humans in organizational behavior expressed through the organization’s decisions, actions and strategies visible to the outside observer.

No doubt that certain organizations in certain circumstances can display questionable, objectionable and downright harmful behaviors and often they don’t really seem like the entities to be trusted with any of the things people care about. Customers are indeed aware of the risks involved in the transactions with the organisation and have tried to defend themselves from unfair practices by establishing [consumer rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_consumer_organizations){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (protection) [organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_organization){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Nevertheless, people in general seem comfortable with trusting corporations as providers of their foods, drinks, medicine, platforms for all kinds of online activities including the ones for keeping in touch with others, managing personal finances, etc. And as long as business goes as usual the organization’s problematic or psychopathic nature may remain more or less hidden, but when something hits the fan and issues arise (irrespective of whether the issues are due to the organization’s failure or the customer’s) its best to be prepared for some hard time trying resolve conflicts, and sorting out those personally important issues.

Just as on a certain level of analysis all organizations are quite alike due to a very small set of sufficiently strong shared features \- the purpose to increase shareholder value above all else through the activities of the organization, which is a key governing principle and the single most important internal purpose unifying directors, board members, executive officers, shareholders and other key stakeholders associated with the organization \- there are a few basic principles that when present give rise to objectionable, unfair even psychopathic organizational behavior. The main features include the external requirement placed on the organization to take responsibility for something, to fix an issue and most importantly to spend time or money on something which would be reasonably expected during a fair deal, but does not directly create wealth in the short-term.

There are general events which usually trigger a subset of the customers who experience problems with a product or service to initiate contact with the “support” team as (paying) customers of an organization. Some triggers may be a part of the normal business and a fully expected behavior from customers like when one has been diligently paying for a health or property insurance for years, and when an illness or lightning strikes, one submits a claim to the insurance company to cover the costs as agreed by both parties in the contract between the customer and the organization. Another kind of trigger may be when the organization changes a policy that is not in the best interest of the customer. There may be errors which are more or less unintentional (but sometimes planned) like a defective product or a non-functional service, overbilling, payments not registered and other kinds of errors on the service provider’s side. Note that in all instances the loss is already incurred by the customer so he / she is already placed at a disadvantage to make up for the losses adding to the stresses already present from the initial problem. A kind of inequality is already present, since the best case for the customer is to break even with significant effort at the mercy of the company policy and the “support” team. And these are the crucial moments where the organization has a chance to act fairly or reveal the psychopath hiding behind all the various masks discussed previously. It is very easy and often more convenient (i.e. less costly) to abuse the imbalance of power and raise roadblocks in front of the customer to prevent them from achieving their goals: make up for a loss, break even from a loss at best, get fair treatment, etc. It is also precisely these circumstances that one can get a glimpse of how the organization actually values customer relationships by observing the organization's choices: is it going to avoid a short-term loss (pay for the mistake now) at the expense of potentially losing a customer on the long term, OR is it going to act fairly making sure that issues are sorted out (especially if they were the fault of the organization\!) by compensating for the customer’s losses ASAP, thereby strengthening the trust for a mutually beneficial relationship in the long-term?

### “Support” teams as secret organizational weapons in disguise

The naive view of customer “support” teams would suggest that such teams are primarily tasked with helping customers with legitimate claims and with solving problems experienced by the customers with a product or service provisioned for sale by the organization. One would assume that “support” teams and members of the wider “support” team are rewarded by the organization based on for example how quickly they reach a satisfactory solution for each customer, what percentage of customers report high levels of satisfaction with the support received, how the number of problems solved contributes to loyal paying customers in the long-term, etc. Well, in such a system that aligns with the customer’s interest (and the organization’s long term-self interest as well by the way), certain features and behaviors would not be allowed as they will be demonstrated through an exemplary case. The presented case is definitely a negative example from the perspective of customer satisfaction, valuation and long term trust, but it may not represent an exceptional case even if hard statistics on the prevalence of similar issues is lacking at least from the public view. Even if global public statistics are scarce or non-existent, one can get stronger-than-anecdotal evidence about how organizations deal with problems using various sources like the ratings provided on various platforms, court cases against certain companies, forums and blogs related to consumer rights violations etc. Real world experiences from such sources suggest that negative experiences with “support” teams and consumer right violations are widely prevalent and are not exceptions to the rule suggesting that negative experience represent a carefully designed strategy from the organization to avoid accountability and most importantly to avoid taking action in hopes to keep some money, whatever small that amount may be, which makes the whole practice even more pathetic and truly psychopathic. To be fair with organizations it would be great to include cases that contradict the prevailing views, by collecting a huge number of cases that get solved in a satisfactory way with minimal friction. But this would require organizations to publish their internal statistics both on unsolved (money kept in) and successfully solved in favour of the paying customer (money paid out) cases. Such a level of transparency would allow the observers to draw a more accurate picture of the organizations given that they were willing to share their data. Such a move may also set the norm for other organizations as well. It is perfectly imaginable that the patterns we see in a small scale are the reflections of the patterns at the larger or the largest scale resembling the concept of [scale invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Based on patterns observed in micro-issues (i.e. the organization tries everything in their power to deflect responsibility and to avoid a small immediate loss), one would expect the same behavioral pattern at play for issues involving more serious violations or bigger costs, potentially invoking even finer tactics and more hideous tricks serving the same underlying purpose: avoid any costs.

**Event date:** 2025.04.25. (56 days after sending a support request, 42 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Notification from the support team that they are “unable to process the refund”.

**Issue:** No explanation why the refund process failed, only providing a completely uninformative explanation that does not make sense in light of the previous events, and considering what triggered the automatic refund process (i.e. closing the payment profile).

**Step taken by customer:** Formulating a response pointing out problems with the work of the wider / dedicated teams, requesting correction of the error.

#### Event 13.

![250425_01_01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drGalapagos/SupportNightmares/refs/heads/main/Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/caseResources/250425_01_01.jpg)

**Event date:** 2025.04.25. (56 days after sending a support request, 42 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Notification from the support team that they are “unable to process the refund”.

**Issue:** No solutions or even an attempt to a solution was provided by the “support” team, acting as if the case was successfully solved and the customer’s request has been addressed properly.

**Step taken by customer:** Formulating another reply to clarify the problems from the customer’s perspective.

#### Event 14.

**Event date:** 2025.04.25. (56 days after sending a support request, 42 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Unsolved case neglected by the support team.

**Issue:** Unsolved case neglected by the support team.

**Step taken by customer:** Formulating another reply to request a quick solution to an already overly delayed process.

#### Event 15.

![250428_00_01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drGalapagos/SupportNightmares/refs/heads/main/Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/caseResources/250428_00_01.jpg)

**Event date:** 2025.04.28. (59 days after sending a support request, 45 days after creating the case).

**Event:** The support team replies that they are working on “workarounds” for a credit to the current Google Ads payment profile, even if previously they stated that such a transfer is not possible (first ignoring this question / request, then claiming the impossibility of such a transfer between Google Ads payment profiles. See Events: 02. 06, & 07.).

**Issue:** The support team provides self-contradicting pieces of information, shows repeated failures to keep their own promises and respect the requests of a paying customer. Note the formulation of a tricky opt-out by default option provided by the support team (i.e. if the customer does not actively reply (opt-in) to the last notification, the default setting is to opt-out from the continuation of the refund process. This way there is a higher chance that the support team will not have to process the refund if a customer forgets or misses to opt-in to continue the process)\!

**Step taken by customer:** Formulating a reply in a similar manner to the ones provided by the support team to minimize the waste of the customer’s valuable time at this point (i.e. copy-paste previous reply)..

#### Event 16.

**Event date:** 2025.04.28. (59 days after sending a support request, 45 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Request from support to opt-in actively if the customer wants to continue with the refund process started 59 days ago.

**Issue:** Failure to delegate the task to an appropriate team member, who is able to complete the promised refund ASAP.

**Step taken by customer:** Waiting patiently after clarifying the request and the case for the 16th time so far.  

#### Event 17.

**Event date:** 2025.04.29. (60 days after sending a support request, 46 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Update about nothing.

**Issue:** Further delay introduced by the support team, another failure to delegate the task to an appropriate team member, who is able to complete the promised refund ASAP.

**Step taken by customer:** Keeping the conversation going, and formulating response while waiting patiently.  

#### Event 18.

![250429_01_01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drGalapagos/SupportNightmares/refs/heads/main/Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/caseResources/250429_01_01.jpg)

**Event date:** 2025.04.29. (60 days after sending a support request, 46 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Update about nothing.

**Issue:** Further delay introduced by the support team, another failure to delegate the task to an appropriate team member, who is able to complete the promised refund ASAP.

**Step taken by customer:** Expressing continued hope for the successful completion of the promised refund by a simple bank transfer.  

#### Event 19.

**Event date:** 2025.05.01. (62 days after sending a support request, 48 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Update about nothing. The support team starts to speculate about some important aspects.

**Issue:** Further delay introduced by the support team, another failure to delegate the task to an appropriate team member, who is able to complete the promised refund ASAP.

**Step taken by customer:** Waiting patiently.  
 
#### Event 20.

**Event date:** 2025.05.07. (68 days after sending a support request, 54 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Update about nothing. The support team is actively working on the case.

**Issue:** Further delay introduced by the support team, another failure to delegate the task to an appropriate team member, who is able to complete the promised refund ASAP.

**Step taken by customer:** Waiting patiently.  

#### Event 21.

![250512_00_01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drGalapagos/SupportNightmares/refs/heads/main/Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/caseResources/250512_00_01.jpg)

**Event date:** 2025.05.12. (73 days after sending a support request, 59 days after creating the case).

**Event:** The refund request (as also mentioned in the subject of email) got magically reframed to a ”credit request” which was already claimed to be impossible by the same support team member (see Event 07.). A perfectly valid refund request (rightful, and in alignment with Google Ads’ own refund policy: [https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1703646](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drGalapagos/SupportNightmares/refs/heads/main/Entities/Google/Ads/Refund/250228_drgalapagos_001/caseResources/https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1703646) ) got magically reframed to a “courtesy credit”. Also note the default option which leads to non-fulfillment of the request in case of inaction from the customer.

**Issue:** Failure to delegate the task to an appropriate team member, who is able to complete the promised refund ASAP, deceptive, self-contradictory communication, disregarding both the request of the customer to transfer the funds to the bank account and disregarding Google Ads’ own refund policy.

**Step taken by customer:** Explaining the request and the unfairness of this procedure one more time to the support team.

**Event date:** 2025.05.14. (75 days after sending a support request, 61 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Notification from the support team that they are still unable to process a legitimate refund. Repetition of the previous answer.

**Issue:** Lack of explanation about what prevents the support team from processing the refund. Lack of justification about why we should trust the claim made by the support team that after cancelling our account the funds will be refunded. The funds were already eligible for a refund, but after 75 days we still have not received them.

**Step taken by customer:** Giving up on this support member and team, no hope of any resolution of the issue. Opening another support request case at Google and filing a complaint to relevant consumer rights protection agencies.  

#### Event 24.

**Event date:** 2025.05.17. (78 days after sending a support request, 64 days after creating the case).

**Event:** Request from Google to rate the experience with the support team. Automatic closure of the case by Google.

**Issue:** Case closed automatically after just 3 days of inactivity from the customer. Note the automatic activation of the shady opt-out by default option.

**Step taken by customer:** Feedback provided on the experience without any hope that it will be used to improve the service in any meaningful way.  

#### Event 27.

**Event date:** 2025.05.22. (83 days after sending the original support request, 69 days after creating the original case).

## Post-mortem autopsy of the exemplary case

### Key assumptions of the autopsy:

Considering the sophistication of the organisation in other areas (biggest player in online ads industry, one of the biggest tech giants), the chance of random errors or similar benevolent “mistakes” during the handling of the case is quite low, therefore how the case is processed by the organization is to a large extent planned, calculated, and follows well-established best practices and scripts which are informed by behavioral sciences. The tactics are primarily aligned with the narrowly defined short-term financial interest of the organization: to generate wealth at all costs, instead of paying for mistakes, whatever small those costs may be on a per case basis, which is in direct opposition to the customer’s interests (and the long-term financial interest of the organization as well).

### Tactics employed by the “support” team based on the evidence presented in the “An exemplary case” section.

1. **Background of the case: a legitimate refund process.**   
   A legitimate refund process (confirmed by Google in their first notification e-mail) triggered by closing one of the Google Ads payment profiles associated with an active advertiser account.[^2]

2. **Error in the organization’s systems triggers the attempt to contact the “support” team.**  
   The successful completion of the refund process was blocked by a mismatch between the user interface and the instructions provided in the notification e-mail. There was no button to click on which was mentioned in the first notification. Worth noting that if there was a button to click on the entire procedure could have been avoided. Is the missing button intentional or a mistake? If it's a mistake is it possible to direct the developer’s attention to it? If a customer takes the time and extra effort to report their mistake, will anyone actually check the report? No answer to this question was ever received.

3. **Overly complicated process just to get in touch with the “support” team.**  
   Contacting the “support” team is intentionally made very difficult. The obvious purpose is to reduce the number of customers who can actually get in touch with the organization. One can get into infinite loops with the useless chatbot which just makes the existing and already read materials more difficult to extract. One has to go through various checks to contact “support” with drop-down lists pre-filled with generic categories. If the issue is not included in the dropdown list, one either has to provide an inaccurate reason or attempt contact in other ways. No contact emails are provided, most branches lead back to the chatbot. This step already consumes a significant amount of time, potentially filtering out a significant percentage of customers, thus preventing them from reaching the “support” team.

4. **Extremely low level of respect by the organization for the “valued” customer’s precious time.**  
   Wasting a lot of the customer’s time and delaying responses is a recurring tactic throughout all the interactions: the first confirmation that a case has been opened, came 2 weeks after sending the initial support request to several email addresses hoping that one of them will land in the right place. The first obvious purpose of delaying communication and solving problems is that the customer may forget about the issue or give up the attempts to get support for the issue, etc. If anything happens to the customer in the significant delays between interactions which prevents further progress is an obvious win for the team and the organization. The second purpose of delaying everything is that the later they need to pay, the more time they have to use the customer’s money. Again, any delay is a net gain for the organization. It is interesting to compare the apparent complications in the case with the efficiency and sophistication implemented in other systems of the same organization like biometric or 1-click payment methods when the goal is to extract funds from customers.

5. **Very low information content (something new) in messages by the “support” team (10-15% of actual payload of overall message content).**  
   The use of a polite boilerplate text in all responses despite the context of the conversation probably aims at mimicking care or empathy for the inconveniences generated by the unsolved issue. Unfortunately this is just superficial charm to make the customer less frustrated temporarily without the emotional depth of appreciating the customer’s real inconveniences. The superficial politeness quickly becomes empty when actual actions by the “support” team don't match up with the signals of fake concerns and fake empathy. Just like the ratio of useful information / total payload in each message by the “support” team, the ratio of information provided by the “support” team compared to the information provided by the customer is around 15% \- a clear evidence of the imbalance in terms of care taken while handling the case.

6. **Regularly ignoring issues / providing explanations for requests that are inconvenient for the “support” team.**  
   Exchanging messages with the “support” team often feels like messaging a halfwit, especially when requests are totally ignored even if they are clearly expressed and repeated, e.g. the request to transfer the funds to the new payment profile instead of a bank transfer was completely ignored by the helpful “support” team member while working feverishly on the case. The question about the total amount to be refunded was also totally ignored by the “support” team. Requests for a real explanation on what prevents the “support” team and the organization to perform a basic bank transfer are always ignored. 

7. **Constantly trying to sneak out of taking any action that would be beneficial for the customer.**  
   Setting artificial deadlines with opt out as a default option in case of no-action from the customer is a subtle dark tactic that is definitely inspired by well-meaning research in behavioral economics which got subverted from its original intention. Abusing an important principle from behavioral economics happens in a way that a choice architecture which was originally intended to improve the decisions people make (see [Nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_\(book\)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein), is turned upside down and perverted into a tactic that is beneficial only for the organization by default. It is similar to the delaying tactic, since any omission from the customer (e.g. forgetting to comply with the instructions, forgetting about the email, etc) is a net gain for the organization, as the rules are set up in such a way that if there is no explicit active action from the customer, the refund is cancelled and the money stays within the organization.

8. **Frequent failure to keep agreements and promises.**  
   This is the situation where the psychopathic nature of the organization becomes really apparent. Business as usual at the “support” team involves: ignoring the organisation’s error that there was no button to click on, then ignoring a request to transfer funds to another payment account in their own system instead of a bank transfer, then delaying the legitimate refund process for almost 2 months, then not keeping their previous promises on completing the refund according to their terms. This step is also very informative about the “rational” calculations that drive the organization’s entire behavior (avoid any costs at all cost), and how they value the loyalty of paying customers for the long-term (not much).

9. **Constant violation of norms governing normal social interaction.**  
   The organization expects compliance in every way (e.g by requesting a lot of documents from the customer just to verify a straightforward and valid refund claim, even though they are sitting already on a pile of documents which all confirm the identity of the customer and the validity of the claim as it comes directly from their own system verifying itself). However, the rule of reciprocity is constantly violated by not showing any sign of respecting the requests from the customer (ignoring requests and questions, not providing the requested information). This may be a major additional source of dissatisfaction as the violations go to a very basic level. Additionally the superficial boilerplate politeness seems cynical due to the internal contradictions and mismatches between what is communicated in real actions and in empty words.

10. **Demonstrating external untrustworthyness and internal inconsistencies as well: wherever there is a chance for such errors to appear, they will appear (arguments requiring logical reasoning).**  
    The organization lies not just to the customer, but it also fails to respect its own internal rules, first by blocking the refund which was started automatically by their own system as a default reaction to a certain customer action and second by contradicting itself several times: 1. Claiming that a transfer of funds to another payment profile within their system is not possible, therefore a bank transfer is needed, then, 2. after the customer provides all the bank account details and waits for more than 1 month, it turns out \- after another inquiry \- that 3. a bank transfer is not possible, but after further push from the customer, 4. it turns out that only a transfer to another payment profile within their system is possible. These obfuscating tactics make one of the world’s biggest tech companies look like a retard and a liar by confusing itself through contractions and internal inconsistencies.

11. **Additional roadblocks and opt-out by default settings in case of inaction from the customer at every possible step.**  
    See Event 10. \- previously there was no need for identity verification to discuss the details of the refund transfer, but at this time it acts as an additional delay and potential blockage of the process. Any claim that this would ensure the customer’s safety is just bullshit in light of the previous interactions where no such check was necessary.

12. **Providing uninformative filler texts to mimic actual progress.**  
    There may be some soft internal rule on acceptable response times to live support cases that can be gamed by “support” team members by providing a filler text response just within the expected timeframe. Again, any delay is a net gain for the organization, any inaction from the customer is a net gain for the organization, therefore any message containing 0 amount of information is sufficient to make it seem like that the case is being processed, when actually nothing is happening.

13. **Recurring logical inconsistencies.**  
    Just like the uninformative filler texts, a no-brainer response may be seen better than no response at all, even if the message contains logical errors and contradictions. See Event 12. informing the customer that since the payment profile has been permanently closed the “support” team is not able to process the refund. Whereas the entire process was triggered BECAUSE of the closure of the payment profile. The standard of “support” reaches new depths.

14. **The “support” team is always ready to close the case at every point during the interaction.**  
    It is worth noting that even after providing a totally illogical and uninformative response (Event 12, 17, 19 \- speculation about what??) more than 1 month after their own deadline for completing a simple transaction, there is no attempt to correct the issue, there is 0 attempt to offer a compensation for the losses. Again, if the customer stops continuing the process for any reason (intentionally or by mistake), it's a clear win for the “support” team and for the organization.

15. **Constant diffusion of responsibility.**  
    The representative of the “support” team often mentions the “wider” / “dedicated” team, which only means that there is no owner of the case, nobody is dealing with it properly. This work structure has a devastating effect on the “support” team members’ work morale as the [diffusion of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} often leads to [moral disengagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_disengagement){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} i.e. a total lack of care about how one’s work impacts others, which is very well demonstrated by “Satish” in this exemplary case.

16. **Magical reframing of the issue.**  
    The words used during any communication set the frame for the situation which influences the mindset of communicators (i.e. the customer and the representatives acting on behalf of the organization). [Frames](https://fbaum.unc.edu/teaching/articles/J-Communication-1993-Entman.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments and suggest remedies. This is a very subtle psycho-linguistic trick that can be used as a rhetorical tactic during interrogations, court hearings and in attempts to influence public opinion by purposefully shifting the focus of a discussion from one topic to another in almost a subliminal way. Note that in Event 21 the legitimate refund request \- initiated by the organization’s own system, then blocked by another system of the same organization, then continuously delayed and blocked by the organization’s “support” team for 73 days up to this point \- got magically reframed to a “courtesy credit”. Nowhere was there any discussion about a courtesy action or credit before \- all the discussion revolved around a legitimate refund which was still kept unlawfully by the organization and not released to the customer.

17. **Ignoring and disrespecting simple requests repeatedly.**  
    Again, the customer’s request to delegate the case to a more competent team member is simply ignored, which is counted as a violation of social norms governing interactions.

18. **Activation of the default opt-out option, as a fail-safe mechanism for the “support” team.**   
    The original case is closed automatically after just 3 days of inactivity from the customer following the miserable discussions with Satish and deciding not to continue with him / her. Nevertheless, the organization is eager to gather extra data on the quality of the interaction with the “support” team. Again, the organization has no respect toward the customer, and acts shamelessly by asking more of the customer’s time with the false pretext that the ratings of the interaction will be used to improve their services. Considering their history of contradictions, external and internal inconsistencies and their narrow minded focus on avoiding even the tiniest cost at all cost, one may be very skeptical whether the term "improvement" implies an improvement that is beneficial for the customer (e.g. educating Satish and his / her dedicated / wider team on how to respect customers and their requests, or changing the policies and scripts that dictate Satish’s behavior, etc.) or for the organization (e.g. by just streamlining the abusive practices to make the contradictions less obvious, adding more logic and polite boilerplate text, fine-tuning the timing of fail-safe the opt-out by default options or improving the identification of customers whose requests need to be respected and whose requests and money can be safely stolen since the person is unlikely to take matters further based on careful analysis of the shared documents, written texts, response times and all the features that this hungry behemoth can harvest from its customers, etc.).

19. **Persistent repetition of the same patterns and consistency between “support” teams.**  
    When people (irrespective of their personal features) operate within the boundaries of the organization which acts as a major filter and amplifier on their personal features and they want to be rewarded for their work or just want to avoid penalties, they will attempt to follow policies and rules [however antisocial those rules and policies may be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obedience){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. In Event 27 a new “support” team member checked the case with his / her wider / dedicated team and entered into the same infinite loop as the previous “support” team member repeating the same well rehearsed, scripted tactics to prevent the legitimate release of the funds to a bank account which is outside of the organization’s boundaries (avoidance of a loss / cost however small that may be).

20. **All message exchanges lack the previous responses and no clear overview of pending / unsolved / solved issues.**  
    Another subtle but efficient dark UX design decision (i.e. a careful web and interaction related architectural choice) is that while normal email messages usually contain the history of all the previous message exchanges providing an almost instantaneous contextual understanding about the ongoing discussion and providing a clear track record of events, interactions with the “support” team follow the exactly opposite pattern that purposefully makes it difficult to track the progress of the case by NEVER including the track record of previous events in the most recent message. Even if these messages are sent in an email format, they are always individual message blocks without any context (except for the subject line). Another strongly related dark UX design decision is that there is no dashboard that would provide a summary of all the live, pending, solved cases anywhere on Google’s platform. It is beyond doubt that a market leading tech giant could easily build a user interface to provide an overview about the “support” requests for the customer… if it was the intention of the organization (or more accurately the intention of the people responsible for these aspects of self-presentation of the organization). But it is clearly not a priority, thus there is just a lack of clear overview of the cases on the customer-facing side of the interface. The choice is understandable considering that providing such a dashboard would make the unfairly and negligently handled cases really easy to extract and make available to the public to help everyone make informed decisions whether they want to engage in transactions with a certain organisation. Obviously such transparency would be against the organization’s interest as long as it sticks to its current practices.

### Summary of the autopsy

The exemplary case provided an excellent glimpse into the true workings and nature of the “support” team at one of the world’s currently largest tech giants (Google). This is not just informative about a “support” team's inadequacy, but reveals a lot about the nature and internal logic of the behemoth within which the “support” teams operate.

The tactics are clearly used in support of the only goal which matters for an organization of this type: maximize profit no matter what. The direct consequence of a hard rule like this is that even paying out a legitimate refund worth around 20 USD becomes impossible within reasonable boundaries related to the effort and time required from the customer. And it must be emphasized that this is not due to errors or mistakes in the decision-making process. This is the default, intended outcome for the organization.

Clearly visible behavioral patterns emerge that are based on dark “best practices". All elements on the list below are carefully designed to prevent costs (i.e. block a legitimate payment in this case) by using a combination of

* dark UX design decisions (missing buttons, almost impossible to reach “support” teams, lack of context in message exchanges, lack of dashboard for pending / solved issues, etc),  
* powerful tactics to delay progress, and potentially exit the process through opt-out by default options,  
* creating confusion,  
* shameless lies,  
* self-contradictions,  
* repeated failures to respect the requests and inquiries of the customer,  
* avoiding honest answers, meanwhile  
* expecting maximum compliance from the customer with requests and rules dictated by the organization but,  
* providing zero compliance in exchange,  
* showing a total lack reciprocity,  
* violation of social norms of normal interaction,  
* deflection of responsibility,  
* etc.

The last interactions with a new “support” team member confirmed that the behavioral patterns and tactics \- demonstrated sometimes well, sometimes not so well by Satish \- are not unique to her / him, but, such patterns and tactics are part of a systematic, calculated, carefully planned and scripted strategy to avoid any costs and deflect any responsibility as long as possible, whatever long-term consequences it may have for the relationship with a customer.

It is not claimed here that all organizations employ such tactics, but whenever one identifies these elements in any interaction with an organization they should be taken seriously signaling the presence of a truly antisocial, psychopathic logic behind the facade. When such signals are clearly identified, searching for solutions within the boundaries of the organization may be futile and one may need to look for solutions outside of the organization.

The overall strategy by certain “support” teams is based on the assumption that people interacting with them are rational economic decision-makers ([even if that rationality is seriously bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}), who will sooner or later realize the [opportunity costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} associated with trying to get their problems fixed by the “support” team. Organizations and their representative “support” teams have an implicit or explicit expectation that people have other things to do, they have other priorities, a limited time to deal with these issues, and that they will eventually give up trying to get help after repeatedly being stonewalled, disrespected and lied to. With the passage of time the initial loss (of functionality of the service, money, satisfaction from the service etc.) seems to shrink in comparison to the troubles caused by the “support” team and the amount of time wasted on trying to get the issue solved by them. So the expectation from the organisation is that sooner or later the true nature of the transaction becomes evident as a [sunk cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and the fallacy (i.e the hope that with more effort positive results will eventually follow) becomes apparent and the help-seeking behavior is abandoned as it only accumulates additional losses which are impossible to recover due to the way “support” teams are set up, operated and rewarded within the organization: as secret weapons tasked with avoiding any cost at all costs. Such “support” teams act as deterrents funneling customer issues and complaints into endless internal loops with the goal of sapping the customer’s motivation to obtain what they are rightfully entitled to. However, it is not just the customer’s motivation that is getting sapped, but money as well, which is defined in law as theft. Therefore, such “support” teams are more accurately characterized as internal scam centers operating under the disguise of providers of assistance for customers in need. Using this disguise “support” teams deliver a double blow to the customer, first by not solving the original issue (representing the initial direct cost), and secondly by wasting a lot of the customer’s time and adding a huge amount of extra frustration (representing the indirect costs such as the externalized costs, opportunity costs, etc.) on top of the initial issue.

## Solutions available for customers

It is highly probable that the previously discussed default expectations of the organization and the “support” team are frequently fulfilled. It would be really surprising to learn that a data-driven tech giant makes any important decision (i.e. how to provide customer “support”) without careful planning and monitoring the effects of their design decisions. So it can be safely assumed that the powerful default options and settings generate the results they are designed to generate, otherwise customers may have very different experiences with “support” teams.

Since it is now evident that certain customer “support” teams (e.g. Google Ads) are only aligned with the organization that feeds them, the naive expectation that customers will get actual support for solving problems with any of the services or products offered by the organization can be safely abandoned. These teams are put into the frontline where customers in need for help are directed through a maze of dark UX elements and when they finally reach a human (as opposed to a useless chatbot), they find the same faceless, brainless and heartless mechanism operating through human “support” team members, who have neither the clue nor the intention of providing any help as dictated by the internal rules and policies of the organization. There is one rule and that rule is to avoid all costs and responsibility at all costs, no matter what the long-term consequences are for the customers or even for the organisation as a matter of fact.

There are however, certain strategies that customers can consider when the friendly mask falls and the organization which previously made all the interactions really smooth and streamlined (especially if the interactions involved extraction of customer money or data) turns out to be a truly antisocial adversary.

It is clear that organizations and their internal scam centers count on the customer’s rationality in several ways. First, customers are expected to give up sooner or later due to the irrecoverable indirect costs. So in order to violate this expectation, nobody should ever give up and everyone needs to be persistent, whether within the boundaries of the organization or preferably outside its boundaries. What is fundamentally needed is a way to turn the adversary’s secret weapon against itself and let their own internal logic do its work until consequences spiral up so that the organization’s best strategy becomes a necessary change of strategy (i.e. handling of customer issues in a way that is more aligned with the customer’s interests which by the way may be more aligned with the organization’s longer-term interests as well, especially if the issues are a result of the organization’s other objectionable practices). Issues should not be fully abandoned and no one should settle for an unfair or illegal outcome, where the result \- however nicely packaged \- is theft of the customer’s money.

The second key expectation of rationality by the organization towards customers is that no individual will ever start a lawsuit (some cost-benefit analysis is expected from the rational customer) below a certain monetary loss threshold, so the organization feels safe harvesting the money illegally across thousands of similar cases below a certain threshold. Where that threshold lies is probably very precisely known and calculated by the organization (per customer) which increases the informational and power imbalance between the individuals and the organization. A remedy against these expectations is to find others exposed to similar transgressions and form collaborative groups. One may be surprised to learn that the critical mass to file a [class action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (lawsuit) is just 40 people who have been exposed to similar practices. “ ... a group in a class action lawsuit could be any person who ever bought a specific dangerous product; in a traditional lawsuit, the plaintiff is a single individual person or business that bought the dangerous product”. In a class action… “instead of each individual person bringing their own lawsuits separately, the class action allows all the claims of all class members—whether they know they have been damaged or not—to be resolved in a single proceeding through the efforts of the representative plaintiff(s) and appointed class counsel.”from: [Wikipedia: Class Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} This means that the number of people that need to successfully cooperate for their shared interests is similar to the number of students found in any random high school class. Groups of this size are potentially easily managed and coordinated even by one or two persons (people who have experience with organizing a mid-sized birthday party, a small sized wedding, etc. may be especially suitable for initiating collective action).

There are [consumer](https://www.consumersinternational.org/who-we-are/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} rights ([protection](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/form/main)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} [groups](https://www.beuc.eu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} that by definition should be very interested and eager to [collect](https://www.icpen.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} information on organizational [misbehavior](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/unfair-treatment/unfair-commercial-practices/index_en.htm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and bad [practices](https://www.watchlist-internet.at/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Their power to influence outcomes possibly depends on a variety of factors including the local laws and regulations, awareness of their existence in the general population, availability of funding, number of staff, willingness of people to report cases, etc. Compared to the number of potential issues that people may be exposed to, consumer rights organizations may not be able to keep up with the pace of abuses. Additionally, the efficiency with which consumer rights organizations can generate positive results and enforce changes is limited by a serious bottleneck as their processes need to pass through the legal systems which are usually not designed for efficiency and speed, but for safety by trying to ensure that no legal or natural person gets punished without proper evidence (i.e. everyone is considered [innocent until proven guilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}). Nevertheless any action is better than no action, so filing a few reports in the present may have benefits in the distant future.

It is worth remembering that huge imbalances of power (between competing organizations and between organizations and their customers) found in case of monopolies are symptoms of a dysfunctional capitalist system. Whether the entire capitalist system is sane or not and whether it is fundamentally flawed or not is irrelevant in this case. What matters in this case is that monopolies and oligopolies fundamentally undermine the internal logic of the capitalist system which is predicated on the concept of [competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_\(economics\)){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} between economic actors in a free market to balance demand and supply and to settle on optimal prices for the producers and consumers leaving everyone “happy” or better off after a transaction. Government interventions and anti-trust laws aim at guarding against such market inefficiencies, but the efficiency of the interventions and the efficiency of the attempts to enforce accountability is questionable when dominant market players are [wealthier than certain countries](https://www.realbusinessrescue.co.uk/advice-hub/companies-worth-more-than-countries){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} trying to regulate them. The fundamental problem with monopolies \- apart from the imbalance created by the immense accumulation of wealth \- is the lack of alternatives to choose from. It is quite difficult to exercise [freedom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_choice){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} when various sectors are dominated by a single dominant service / product provider. Free choice then is reduced to a choice between accepting all terms and conditions dictated by a giant with all the unfavorable settings forced upon the customer vs. not to participate in the game at all if one objects to even one condition in the contractual agreement (i.e. terms and conditions / end-user license agreement). There are alternatives one can turn to, even if it means one has to give up some level of [convenience](https://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/04/14/oppmann.off.the.grid/index.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} or efficiency for better [privacy](https://medium.com/@th3Powell/the-privacy-paradox-balancing-security-and-convenience-2a63a76ca773){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The sacrifices may be temporary and may well be worth the effort to allow alternative organizations to grow and develop, potentially taking different directions than the bloated, abusive competitors. Such an outcome requires collective action by customers and tight feedback loops during the development of alternatives, so the alternative organizations are guided by true market forces during their development.

[Monopolies not just rob people](https://www.politico.eu/article/anti-google-petition-eu-demand-break-up-tech-giant-alphabet-digital-technology-monopoly/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} of their freedom of choice by limiting the number of potential alternatives one is allowed to choose to zero, but they also force a subverted logic on people by dictating the rules and by policing behavior. Monopolies turn common sense upside down and attempt to draw a false picture of the entire state of affairs. The [logic of the monopoly](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/todays-european-commission-announcement-about-our-advertising-technology/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} attempts to convince everyone that customers exist for a sole purpose: to serve the organization and to help it achieve its goal by paying for its products or services. The uncontrolled organization in a monopoly position begins to act as a police enforcing its own rules and if some customers are not behaving according to the rules dictated by the organization they may get penalized without any way to appeal the decisions apart from being directed to the “support” teams which are already used as weapons against the customer. Situations like this should never happen in the first place, but once they develop, it is of prime importance to re-establish and to reinforce the appropriate logic, the relevant human rights including [the right to privacy](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the proper causal chain through collective action.

It is also worth reminding ourselves at this point why organizations exist and why they may grow disproportionately huge. Organizations on one hand have a clear goal to accumulate wealth and their natural tendency would be to grow infinitely if it was only up to them to follow their internal maxima. What seems to be overlooked and worth remembering is the other necessary condition for an organization’s existence: it is supposed to provide something that people are willing to pay for. As soon as customers’ willingness to pay for a service or product vanishes, a key reason for the organization’s existence disappears as well. Therefore the correct(ed) logic is that the organization’s existence depends on its ability to fulfill customer needs. As soon as they fail to achieve that, there is no valid reason for their existence. Customer choice is therefore key.

When the service degrades to unacceptable levels, or the organization grows way too aggressive or antisocial, there is a very simple solution which is available for anyone to use: just stop using the service or product, stop paying for something that is not aligned with one’s individual goals. Given that organizations have one primary goal, they must be really sensitive to any changes in the environment that may have a negative impact on reaching that single goal. This provides customers a very rational, straightforward and simple to use mechanism to force organizations to modify their repulsive behaviors and practices. People need to be aware of and exercise their rights to prevent organizations from transgressing their limits (which they are pretty prone to unless clear and immediate collective feedback is provided). Through such awareness and by actively expressing values through actions customers may be able to guide the misbehaving organization to teach them what is acceptable and what is not by using the environment wisely. Establishing a [high-validity environment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26798603_Conditions_for_Intuitive_Expertise){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} requires stable relationships between objectively identifiable cues and the outcomes of the actions along with frequent, unambiguous feedback preferably immediately following the actions of the organization.

There is an excellent recent example of the principle at work demonstrating the power of [collective action](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-sales-key-european-markets-plunge-april-2025-05-02/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (i.e. unambiguous feedback provided by disgusted customers) on an organization whose CEO repeatedly violated fundamental norms that people value highly. Customer feedback in the form of boycotts or collective abandonment of an organisation, or brand has clearly visible and near immediate effects. It is especially efficient compared to overly complicated, bureaucratic government interventions and lengthy lawsuits. A clear demonstration of the efficiency of collective conscious choice is that it relatively quickly forced the world’s (second, third?) richest man to reconsider his public actions in his own best (financial) interest. Which he did, as a rational self-interested individual acting on behalf of the organization’s shareholders. Interesting to note that the plummeting of Tesla stocks due to collective customer action had nothing to do with the quality of the products, nevertheless a message was clearly communicated using the only language that organizations and their representatives seem to understand easily: sales going down. So if effective action is needed with the least possible lag just abandon the misbehaving bastards completely and collectively permanently or temporarily until they fix themselves.

With the right shared mindset and through collective action the control to regulate organisational misbehavior is placed directly into the hands of the customers. This kind of control requires consciousness, consistency and coordination among a large number of individuals. What organisations are exceptionally good at is to unite individuals for a common goal. Cooperation and collaboration are essential features required for collective action whether that action is a class action, a collective abandonment of an organization and its products or the creation of new organisations with different approaches. The productive and constructive solution is to cooperate and develop the alternatives, reinvent and reimagine the economic system, create revolutionary business models that can replace the current morass of advertisement-based business models that pollute the informational environment, design products that preserve [privacy](https://www.goatcounter.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} instead of violating it, bring to life organisations that are truly able to serve a broader set of goals than the financial interest of the stakeholders, etc.

It is also a great opportunity to clarify personal values, commitments and align ideals with real-world actions. When collective action is properly organized and directed to a goal many of the greatest harms could be avoided simply by modifying the choices customers make. No organisation would continue extracting natural resources and polluting nature at ever-increasing rates if there was no customer need and a willingness to pay for the products created from such processes. It is useful to ask what exactly are the tradeoffs we make on a daily basis through our (automatic) choices. One may have to answer tough questions after some introspection about the level of destruction that is acceptable to establish or maintain a certain level of convenience and comfort etc.

As a first step toward reimagining how other potential realities would look like based on a completely different economic system, which is rooted in a completely different mindset with other kinds of valuations, one may get inspiration from the ideas in [Buddhist economics](https://www.academia.edu/download/119505763/WESTERN_ECONOMICS_VERSUS_BUDDHIST_ECONOM.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The consequences of a simple-looking realization made about 2500 years ago \- that suffering is at the core of existence \- are far-reaching. It leads to the attitude which aims at reducing (or at least not increasing) the overall suffering, where suffering is extended to all sentient beings. Another basic principle that follows from suffering is the practice of self-restraint through simplifying desires instead of cultivating and generating them (as often done in the capitalist economic system). Through some practice one may eventually realize that freedom comes not from the constant and compulsive fulfillment of desires which gives rise to new desires perpetually, but from releasing the desires and letting go of attachments to the objects that provide false promises of solving human problems. When that state is achieved by all individuals and the veils blurring our vision are removed, the need for any kind of support will dissipate into the great void of pure existence.

[^1]:  Whether the business environment itself is governed by unmodifiable natural laws or it is a product of some very basic human features and behavioral tendencies (i.e. paranoia about the competitor’s behavior, avoidance of uncertainty, etc) needs to be investigated.

[^2]:  Closing the original payment profile associated with the recently successfully triple-verified advertiser account was necessitated by various complications related to the newly introduced advertiser verification requirements. The third verification took several months to pass despite the fact that all documentation was provided for the verification process (that process is worth a separate post). On Google Ads one advertiser account can have several associated payment profiles, and in this case a new one was already created where the funds should have been transferred instead of a bank transfer according to the first request of the customer (which by the way, would be also more beneficial for the organisation).
